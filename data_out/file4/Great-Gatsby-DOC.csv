1,0,In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice,Great Gatsby
1,1,that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.,Great Gatsby
1,2,"“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just",Great Gatsby
1,3,remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages,Great Gatsby
1,4,that you’ve had.”,Great Gatsby
1,5,"He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative",Great Gatsby
1,6,"in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more",Great Gatsby
1,7,"than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a",Great Gatsby
1,8,habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me,Great Gatsby
1,9,the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to,Great Gatsby
1,10,detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal,Great Gatsby
1,11,"person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of",Great Gatsby
1,12,"being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,",Great Gatsby
1,13,unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have,Great Gatsby
1,14,"feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by",Great Gatsby
1,15,some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on,Great Gatsby
1,16,"the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least",Great Gatsby
1,17,"the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and",Great Gatsby
1,18,marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of,Great Gatsby
1,19,infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I,Great Gatsby
1,20,"forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly",Great Gatsby
1,21,"repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out",Great Gatsby
1,22,unequally at birth.,Great Gatsby
1,23,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission",Great Gatsby
1,24,that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the,Great Gatsby
1,25,"wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded",Great Gatsby
1,26,on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted,Great Gatsby
1,27,the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I,Great Gatsby
1,28,wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the,Great Gatsby
1,29,"human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was",Great Gatsby
1,30,"exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I",Great Gatsby
1,31,have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of,Great Gatsby
1,32,"successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some",Great Gatsby
1,33,"heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related",Great Gatsby
1,34,to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten,Great Gatsby
1,35,thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that,Great Gatsby
1,36,flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the,Great Gatsby
1,37,"“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a",Great Gatsby
1,38,romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and,Great Gatsby
1,39,which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out,Great Gatsby
1,40,"all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust",Great Gatsby
1,41,floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my,Great Gatsby
1,42,interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.,Great Gatsby
1,43,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
1,44,"My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle",Great Gatsby
1,45,Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a,Great Gatsby
1,46,"clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of",Great Gatsby
1,47,"Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s",Great Gatsby
1,48,"brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil",Great Gatsby
1,49,"War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father",Great Gatsby
1,50,carries on today.,Great Gatsby
1,51,"I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with",Great Gatsby
1,52,special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in,Great Gatsby
1,53,"father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of",Great Gatsby
1,54,"a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that",Great Gatsby
1,55,delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the,Great Gatsby
1,56,counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being,Great Gatsby
1,57,"the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the",Great Gatsby
1,58,ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond,Great Gatsby
1,59,"business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it",Great Gatsby
1,60,could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it,Great Gatsby
1,61,"over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,",Great Gatsby
1,62,"“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance",Great Gatsby
1,63,"me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I",Great Gatsby
1,64,"thought, in the spring of twenty-two.",Great Gatsby
1,65,"The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm",Great Gatsby
1,66,"season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly",Great Gatsby
1,67,"trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a",Great Gatsby
1,68,"house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He",Great Gatsby
1,69,"found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a",Great Gatsby
1,70,"month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and",Great Gatsby
1,71,I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a,Great Gatsby
1,72,"few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who",Great Gatsby
1,73,made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to,Great Gatsby
1,74,herself over the electric stove.,Great Gatsby
1,75,"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more",Great Gatsby
1,76,"recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.",Great Gatsby
1,77,“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.,Great Gatsby
1,78,"I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,",Great Gatsby
1,79,"a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the",Great Gatsby
1,80,freedom of the neighbourhood.,Great Gatsby
1,81,And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the,Great Gatsby
1,82,"trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar",Great Gatsby
1,83,conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.,Great Gatsby
1,84,"There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to",Great Gatsby
1,85,be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen,Great Gatsby
1,86,"volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they",Great Gatsby
1,87,"stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,",Great Gatsby
1,88,promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and,Great Gatsby
1,89,Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other,Great Gatsby
1,90,books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a,Great Gatsby
1,91,series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now,Great Gatsby
1,92,I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become,Great Gatsby
1,93,"again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”",Great Gatsby
1,94,This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at,Great Gatsby
1,95,"from a single window, after all.",Great Gatsby
1,96,It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of,Great Gatsby
1,97,the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender,Great Gatsby
1,98,riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where,Great Gatsby
1,99,"there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of",Great Gatsby
1,100,"land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in",Great Gatsby
1,101,"contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most",Great Gatsby
1,102,"domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great",Great Gatsby
1,103,wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the,Great Gatsby
1,104,"egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact",Great Gatsby
1,105,end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual,Great Gatsby
1,106,wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more,Great Gatsby
1,107,interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular,Great Gatsby
1,108,except shape and size.,Great Gatsby
1,109,"I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though",Great Gatsby
1,110,this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little,Great Gatsby
1,111,sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the,Great Gatsby
1,112,"egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge",Great Gatsby
1,113,places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on,Great Gatsby
1,114,my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual,Great Gatsby
1,115,"imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one",Great Gatsby
1,116,"side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble",Great Gatsby
1,117,"swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was",Great Gatsby
1,118,"Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a",Great Gatsby
1,119,mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an,Great Gatsby
1,120,"eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I",Great Gatsby
1,121,"had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and",Great Gatsby
1,122,the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a,Great Gatsby
1,123,month.,Great Gatsby
1,124,Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg,Great Gatsby
1,125,"glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins",Great Gatsby
1,126,on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom,Great Gatsby
1,127,"Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom",Great Gatsby
1,128,in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in,Great Gatsby
1,129,Chicago.,Great Gatsby
1,130,"Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of",Great Gatsby
1,131,the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a,Great Gatsby
1,132,"national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute",Great Gatsby
1,133,limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of,Great Gatsby
1,134,anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his,Great Gatsby
1,135,freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago,Great Gatsby
1,136,and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for,Great Gatsby
1,137,"instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake",Great Gatsby
1,138,Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was,Great Gatsby
1,139,wealthy enough to do that.,Great Gatsby
1,140,Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for,Great Gatsby
1,141,"no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully",Great Gatsby
1,142,wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a,Great Gatsby
1,143,"permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe",Great Gatsby
1,144,"it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift",Great Gatsby
1,145,"on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of",Great Gatsby
1,146,some irrecoverable football game.,Great Gatsby
1,147,And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East,Great Gatsby
1,148,Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house,Great Gatsby
1,149,"was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white",Great Gatsby
1,150,"Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at",Great Gatsby
1,151,"the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,",Great Gatsby
1,152,jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when,Great Gatsby
1,153,it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though,Great Gatsby
1,154,from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French,Great Gatsby
1,155,"windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm",Great Gatsby
1,156,"windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with",Great Gatsby
1,157,his legs apart on the front porch.,Great Gatsby
1,158,He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy,Great Gatsby
1,159,"straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a",Great Gatsby
1,160,supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established,Great Gatsby
1,161,dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning,Great Gatsby
1,162,aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding,Great Gatsby
1,163,clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill,Great Gatsby
1,164,"those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could",Great Gatsby
1,165,see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his,Great Gatsby
1,166,thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.,Great Gatsby
1,167,"His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of",Great Gatsby
1,168,fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in,Great Gatsby
1,169,"it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who",Great Gatsby
1,170,had hated his guts.,Great Gatsby
1,171,"“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to",Great Gatsby
1,172,"say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We",Great Gatsby
1,173,"were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I",Great Gatsby
1,174,always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like,Great Gatsby
1,175,"him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.",Great Gatsby
1,176,We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.,Great Gatsby
1,177,"“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about",Great Gatsby
1,178,restlessly.,Great Gatsby
1,179,"Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the",Great Gatsby
1,180,"front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half",Great Gatsby
1,181,"acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped",Great Gatsby
1,182,the tide offshore.,Great Gatsby
1,183,"“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,",Great Gatsby
1,184,politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”,Great Gatsby
1,185,"We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,",Great Gatsby
1,186,fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The,Great Gatsby
1,187,windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside,Great Gatsby
1,188,that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through,Great Gatsby
1,189,"the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale",Great Gatsby
1,190,"flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the",Great Gatsby
1,191,"ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow",Great Gatsby
1,192,on it as wind does on the sea.,Great Gatsby
1,193,The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous,Great Gatsby
1,194,couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an,Great Gatsby
1,195,"anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were",Great Gatsby
1,196,rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a,Great Gatsby
1,197,short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments,Great Gatsby
1,198,listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a,Great Gatsby
1,199,picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the,Great Gatsby
1,200,"rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the",Great Gatsby
1,201,curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the,Great Gatsby
1,202,floor.,Great Gatsby
1,203,The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full,Great Gatsby
1,204,"length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her",Great Gatsby
1,205,"chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which",Great Gatsby
1,206,was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes,Great Gatsby
1,207,"she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring",Great Gatsby
1,208,an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.,Great Gatsby
1,209,"The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly",Great Gatsby
1,210,"forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,",Great Gatsby
1,211,"charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the",Great Gatsby
1,212,room.,Great Gatsby
1,213,“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”,Great Gatsby
1,214,"She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my",Great Gatsby
1,215,"hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was",Great Gatsby
1,216,no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she,Great Gatsby
1,217,had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was,Great Gatsby
1,218,Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people,Great Gatsby
1,219,lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less,Great Gatsby
1,220,charming.),Great Gatsby
1,221,"At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost",Great Gatsby
1,222,"imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object",Great Gatsby
1,223,she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her,Great Gatsby
1,224,something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.,Great Gatsby
1,225,Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned,Great Gatsby
1,226,tribute from me.,Great Gatsby
1,227,"I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,",Great Gatsby
1,228,thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and,Great Gatsby
1,229,"down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be",Great Gatsby
1,230,"played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,",Great Gatsby
1,231,"bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement",Great Gatsby
1,232,in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:,Great Gatsby
1,233,"a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had",Great Gatsby
1,234,"done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,",Great Gatsby
1,235,exciting things hovering in the next hour.,Great Gatsby
1,236,"I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,",Great Gatsby
1,237,and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.,Great Gatsby
1,238,“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.,Great Gatsby
1,239,“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel,Great Gatsby
1,240,"painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all",Great Gatsby
1,241,night along the north shore.”,Great Gatsby
1,242,"“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added",Great Gatsby
1,243,irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”,Great Gatsby
1,244,“I’d like to.”,Great Gatsby
1,245,“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”,Great Gatsby
1,246,“Never.”,Great Gatsby
1,247,"“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”",Great Gatsby
1,248,"Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped",Great Gatsby
1,249,and rested his hand on my shoulder.,Great Gatsby
1,250,"“What you doing, Nick?”",Great Gatsby
1,251,“I’m a bond man.”,Great Gatsby
1,252,“Who with?”,Great Gatsby
1,253,I told him.,Great Gatsby
1,254,"“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.",Great Gatsby
1,255,This annoyed me.,Great Gatsby
1,256,"“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”",Great Gatsby
1,257,"“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at",Great Gatsby
1,258,"Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something",Great Gatsby
1,259,more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”,Great Gatsby
1,260,At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that,Great Gatsby
1,261,I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the,Great Gatsby
1,262,"room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned",Great Gatsby
1,263,"and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.",Great Gatsby
1,264,"“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long",Great Gatsby
1,265,as I can remember.”,Great Gatsby
1,266,"“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to",Great Gatsby
1,267,New York all afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
1,268,"“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the",Great Gatsby
1,269,pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”,Great Gatsby
1,270,Her host looked at her incredulously.,Great Gatsby
1,271,“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom,Great Gatsby
1,272,of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”,Great Gatsby
1,273,"I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I",Great Gatsby
1,274,"enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with",Great Gatsby
1,275,"an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward",Great Gatsby
1,276,at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked,Great Gatsby
1,277,"back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,",Great Gatsby
1,278,"discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a",Great Gatsby
1,279,"picture of her, somewhere before.",Great Gatsby
1,280,"“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody",Great Gatsby
1,281,there.”,Great Gatsby
1,282,“I don’t know a single—”,Great Gatsby
1,283,“You must know Gatsby.”,Great Gatsby
1,284,“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”,Great Gatsby
1,285,Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;,Great Gatsby
1,286,"wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled",Great Gatsby
1,287,me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.,Great Gatsby
1,288,"Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two",Great Gatsby
1,289,"young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward",Great Gatsby
1,290,"the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the",Great Gatsby
1,291,diminished wind.,Great Gatsby
1,292,"“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her",Great Gatsby
1,293,fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She,Great Gatsby
1,294,looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day,Great Gatsby
1,295,of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in,Great Gatsby
1,296,the year and then miss it.”,Great Gatsby
1,297,"“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the",Great Gatsby
1,298,table as if she were getting into bed.,Great Gatsby
1,299,"“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me",Great Gatsby
1,300,helplessly: “What do people plan?”,Great Gatsby
1,301,Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her,Great Gatsby
1,302,little finger.,Great Gatsby
1,303,“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”,Great Gatsby
1,304,We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.,Great Gatsby
1,305,"“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,",Great Gatsby
1,306,"but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a",Great Gatsby
1,307,"great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”",Great Gatsby
1,308,"“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in",Great Gatsby
1,309,kidding.”,Great Gatsby
1,310,"“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.",Great Gatsby
1,311,"Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a",Great Gatsby
1,312,"bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool",Great Gatsby
1,313,as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all,Great Gatsby
1,314,"desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a",Great Gatsby
1,315,polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew,Great Gatsby
1,316,that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too,Great Gatsby
1,317,would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the,Great Gatsby
1,318,"West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its",Great Gatsby
1,319,"close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer",Great Gatsby
1,320,nervous dread of the moment itself.,Great Gatsby
1,321,"“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass",Great Gatsby
1,322,of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or,Great Gatsby
1,323,something?”,Great Gatsby
1,324,"I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in",Great Gatsby
1,325,an unexpected way.,Great Gatsby
1,326,"“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve",Great Gatsby
1,327,gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise,Great Gatsby
1,328,of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”,Great Gatsby
1,329,"“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.",Great Gatsby
1,330,"“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is",Great Gatsby
1,331,if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly,Great Gatsby
1,332,submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”,Great Gatsby
1,333,"“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of",Great Gatsby
1,334,unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in,Great Gatsby
1,335,them. What was that word we—”,Great Gatsby
1,336,"“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her",Great Gatsby
1,337,impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to,Great Gatsby
1,338,"us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will",Great Gatsby
1,339,have control of things.”,Great Gatsby
1,340,"“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously",Great Gatsby
1,341,toward the fervent sun.,Great Gatsby
1,342,"“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom",Great Gatsby
1,343,interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.,Great Gatsby
1,344,"“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,",Great Gatsby
1,345,and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a,Great Gatsby
1,346,"slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the",Great Gatsby
1,347,"things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all",Great Gatsby
1,348,that. Do you see?”,Great Gatsby
1,349,"There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his",Great Gatsby
1,350,"complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.",Great Gatsby
1,351,"When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler",Great Gatsby
1,352,left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned,Great Gatsby
1,353,towards me.,Great Gatsby
1,354,"“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.",Great Gatsby
1,355,“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s,Great Gatsby
1,356,nose?”,Great Gatsby
1,357,“That’s why I came over tonight.”,Great Gatsby
1,358,"“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher",Great Gatsby
1,359,for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred,Great Gatsby
1,360,"people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it",Great Gatsby
1,361,began to affect his nose—”,Great Gatsby
1,362,"“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.",Great Gatsby
1,363,"“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up",Great Gatsby
1,364,his position.”,Great Gatsby
1,365,For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her,Great Gatsby
1,366,glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I,Great Gatsby
1,367,"listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering",Great Gatsby
1,368,"regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.",Great Gatsby
1,369,"The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,",Great Gatsby
1,370,"whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went",Great Gatsby
1,371,"inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned",Great Gatsby
1,372,"forward again, her voice glowing and singing.",Great Gatsby
1,373,"“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an",Great Gatsby
1,374,absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:,Great Gatsby
1,375,“An absolute rose?”,Great Gatsby
1,376,This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only,Great Gatsby
1,377,"extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart",Great Gatsby
1,378,"was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,",Great Gatsby
1,379,thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and,Great Gatsby
1,380,excused herself and went into the house.,Great Gatsby
1,381,Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of,Great Gatsby
1,382,meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”,Great Gatsby
1,383,in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the,Great Gatsby
1,384,"room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to",Great Gatsby
1,385,"hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,",Great Gatsby
1,386,"mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.",Great Gatsby
1,387,“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.,Great Gatsby
1,388,“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”,Great Gatsby
1,389,“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.,Great Gatsby
1,390,"“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.",Great Gatsby
1,391,“I thought everybody knew.”,Great Gatsby
1,392,“I don’t.”,Great Gatsby
1,393,“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”,Great Gatsby
1,394,“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.,Great Gatsby
1,395,Miss Baker nodded.,Great Gatsby
1,396,“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.,Great Gatsby
1,397,Don’t you think?”,Great Gatsby
1,398,Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a,Great Gatsby
1,399,"dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at",Great Gatsby
1,400,the table.,Great Gatsby
1,401,“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.,Great Gatsby
1,402,"She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and",Great Gatsby
1,403,"continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic",Great Gatsby
1,404,outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a,Great Gatsby
1,405,nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing,Great Gatsby
1,406,"away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”",Great Gatsby
1,407,"“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light",Great Gatsby
1,408,"enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”",Great Gatsby
1,409,"The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head",Great Gatsby
1,410,"decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,",Great Gatsby
1,411,vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes,Great Gatsby
1,412,"at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I",Great Gatsby
1,413,"was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to",Great Gatsby
1,414,"avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but",Great Gatsby
1,415,"I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain",Great Gatsby
1,416,"hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill",Great Gatsby
1,417,metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation,Great Gatsby
1,418,might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone,Great Gatsby
1,419,immediately for the police.,Great Gatsby
1,420,"The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss",Great Gatsby
1,421,"Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into",Great Gatsby
1,422,"the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,",Great Gatsby
1,423,"trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed",Great Gatsby
1,424,Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In,Great Gatsby
1,425,its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.,Great Gatsby
1,426,"Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and",Great Gatsby
1,427,her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that,Great Gatsby
1,428,"turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be",Great Gatsby
1,429,some sedative questions about her little girl.,Great Gatsby
1,430,"“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even",Great Gatsby
1,431,if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”,Great Gatsby
1,432,“I wasn’t back from the war.”,Great Gatsby
1,433,"“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,",Great Gatsby
1,434,and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”,Great Gatsby
1,435,"Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,",Great Gatsby
1,436,and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her,Great Gatsby
1,437,daughter.,Great Gatsby
1,438,"“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”",Great Gatsby
1,439,"“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you",Great Gatsby
1,440,what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”,Great Gatsby
1,441,“Very much.”,Great Gatsby
1,442,"“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was",Great Gatsby
1,443,less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of,Great Gatsby
1,444,"the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right",Great Gatsby
1,445,"away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I",Great Gatsby
1,446,"turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a",Great Gatsby
1,447,girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be,Great Gatsby
1,448,"in this world, a beautiful little fool.’",Great Gatsby
1,449,"“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a",Great Gatsby
1,450,convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I,Great Gatsby
1,451,know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”,Great Gatsby
1,452,"Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and",Great Gatsby
1,453,"she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m",Great Gatsby
1,454,sophisticated!”,Great Gatsby
1,455,"The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my",Great Gatsby
1,456,"belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me",Great Gatsby
1,457,"uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to",Great Gatsby
1,458,"exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a",Great Gatsby
1,459,"moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as",Great Gatsby
1,460,if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret,Great Gatsby
1,461,society to which she and Tom belonged.,Great Gatsby
1,462,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
1,463,"Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at",Great Gatsby
1,464,either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the,Great Gatsby
1,465,"Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running",Great Gatsby
1,466,"together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and",Great Gatsby
1,467,"dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as",Great Gatsby
1,468,she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.,Great Gatsby
1,469,When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.,Great Gatsby
1,470,"“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in",Great Gatsby
1,471,our very next issue.”,Great Gatsby
1,472,"Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she",Great Gatsby
1,473,stood up.,Great Gatsby
1,474,"“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the",Great Gatsby
1,475,ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”,Great Gatsby
1,476,"“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,",Great Gatsby
1,477,“over at Westchester.”,Great Gatsby
1,478,“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”,Great Gatsby
1,479,I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous,Great Gatsby
1,480,expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the,Great Gatsby
1,481,sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard,Great Gatsby
1,482,"some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I",Great Gatsby
1,483,had forgotten long ago.,Great Gatsby
1,484,"“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”",Great Gatsby
1,485,“If you’ll get up.”,Great Gatsby
1,486,"“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”",Great Gatsby
1,487,"“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a",Great Gatsby
1,488,"marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you",Great Gatsby
1,489,together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push,Great Gatsby
1,490,"you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”",Great Gatsby
1,491,"“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a",Great Gatsby
1,492,word.”,Great Gatsby
1,493,"“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let",Great Gatsby
1,494,her run around the country this way.”,Great Gatsby
1,495,“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.,Great Gatsby
1,496,“Her family.”,Great Gatsby
1,497,"“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s",Great Gatsby
1,498,"going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots",Great Gatsby
1,499,of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be,Great Gatsby
1,500,very good for her.”,Great Gatsby
1,501,Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.,Great Gatsby
1,502,“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.,Great Gatsby
1,503,“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our,Great Gatsby
1,504,beautiful white—”,Great Gatsby
1,505,“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”,Great Gatsby
1,506,demanded Tom suddenly.,Great Gatsby
1,507,"“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we",Great Gatsby
1,508,"talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept",Great Gatsby
1,509,up on us and first thing you know—”,Great Gatsby
1,510,"“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.",Great Gatsby
1,511,"I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes",Great Gatsby
1,512,later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood,Great Gatsby
1,513,side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor,Great Gatsby
1,514,Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”,Great Gatsby
1,515,"“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were",Great Gatsby
1,516,engaged to a girl out West.”,Great Gatsby
1,517,"“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were",Great Gatsby
1,518,engaged.”,Great Gatsby
1,519,“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”,Great Gatsby
1,520,"“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again",Great Gatsby
1,521,"in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be",Great Gatsby
1,522,true.”,Great Gatsby
1,523,"Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even",Great Gatsby
1,524,vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one,Great Gatsby
1,525,of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old,Great Gatsby
1,526,"friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention",Great Gatsby
1,527,of being rumoured into marriage.,Great Gatsby
1,528,Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely,Great Gatsby
1,529,"rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove",Great Gatsby
1,530,away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out,Great Gatsby
1,531,"of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such",Great Gatsby
1,532,"intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman",Great Gatsby
1,533,in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been,Great Gatsby
1,534,depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of,Great Gatsby
1,535,stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his,Great Gatsby
1,536,peremptory heart.,Great Gatsby
1,537,Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside,Great Gatsby
1,538,"garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and",Great Gatsby
1,539,when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and,Great Gatsby
1,540,sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had,Great Gatsby
1,541,"blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the",Great Gatsby
1,542,trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth,Great Gatsby
1,543,blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered,Great Gatsby
1,544,"across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I",Great Gatsby
1,545,was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of,Great Gatsby
1,546,my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets,Great Gatsby
1,547,regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely,Great Gatsby
1,548,movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested,Great Gatsby
1,549,"that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was",Great Gatsby
1,550,his of our local heavens.,Great Gatsby
1,551,"I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and",Great Gatsby
1,552,"that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he",Great Gatsby
1,553,gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched,Great Gatsby
1,554,"out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was",Great Gatsby
1,555,"from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced",Great Gatsby
1,556,"seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute",Great Gatsby
1,557,"and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked",Great Gatsby
1,558,"once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the",Great Gatsby
1,559,unquiet darkness.,Great Gatsby
2,0,About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily,Great Gatsby
2,1,"joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as",Great Gatsby
2,2,to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley,Great Gatsby
2,3,of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and,Great Gatsby
2,4,hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and,Great Gatsby
2,5,"chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of",Great Gatsby
2,6,"ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery",Great Gatsby
2,7,"air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,",Great Gatsby
2,8,"gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the",Great Gatsby
2,9,ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable,Great Gatsby
2,10,"cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.",Great Gatsby
2,11,But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift,Great Gatsby
2,12,"endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.",Great Gatsby
2,13,J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and,Great Gatsby
2,14,"gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,",Great Gatsby
2,15,"but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass",Great Gatsby
2,16,over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set,Great Gatsby
2,17,"them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then",Great Gatsby
2,18,"sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved",Great Gatsby
2,19,"away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun",Great Gatsby
2,20,"and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.",Great Gatsby
2,21,"The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,",Great Gatsby
2,22,"when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on",Great Gatsby
2,23,waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an,Great Gatsby
2,24,"hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was",Great Gatsby
2,25,because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.,Great Gatsby
2,26,The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His,Great Gatsby
2,27,acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés,Great Gatsby
2,28,"with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with",Great Gatsby
2,29,"whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire",Great Gatsby
2,30,to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one,Great Gatsby
2,31,"afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet",Great Gatsby
2,32,"and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.",Great Gatsby
2,33,"“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”",Great Gatsby
2,34,"I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination",Great Gatsby
2,35,to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption,Great Gatsby
2,36,was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.,Great Gatsby
2,37,"I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked",Great Gatsby
2,38,back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s,Great Gatsby
2,39,persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of,Great Gatsby
2,40,"yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact",Great Gatsby
2,41,"Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.",Great Gatsby
2,42,One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an,Great Gatsby
2,43,"all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a",Great Gatsby
2,44,garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed,Great Gatsby
2,45,Tom inside.,Great Gatsby
2,46,The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the,Great Gatsby
2,47,dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had,Great Gatsby
2,48,"occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that",Great Gatsby
2,49,"sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the",Great Gatsby
2,50,"proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands",Great Gatsby
2,51,"on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and",Great Gatsby
2,52,faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his,Great Gatsby
2,53,light blue eyes.,Great Gatsby
2,54,"“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the",Great Gatsby
2,55,shoulder. “How’s business?”,Great Gatsby
2,56,"“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you",Great Gatsby
2,57,going to sell me that car?”,Great Gatsby
2,58,“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”,Great Gatsby
2,59,"“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”",Great Gatsby
2,60,"“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,",Great Gatsby
2,61,maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”,Great Gatsby
2,62,"“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”",Great Gatsby
2,63,His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.,Great Gatsby
2,64,"Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish",Great Gatsby
2,65,figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was,Great Gatsby
2,66,"in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh",Great Gatsby
2,67,"sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark",Great Gatsby
2,68,"blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there",Great Gatsby
2,69,was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of,Great Gatsby
2,70,"her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking",Great Gatsby
2,71,"through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,",Great Gatsby
2,72,"looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without",Great Gatsby
2,73,"turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:",Great Gatsby
2,74,"“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”",Great Gatsby
2,75,"“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little",Great Gatsby
2,76,"office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A",Great Gatsby
2,77,white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled,Great Gatsby
2,78,"everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.",Great Gatsby
2,79,"“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”",Great Gatsby
2,80,“All right.”,Great Gatsby
2,81,“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”,Great Gatsby
2,82,She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with,Great Gatsby
2,83,two chairs from his office door.,Great Gatsby
2,84,We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days,Great Gatsby
2,85,"before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was",Great Gatsby
2,86,setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.,Great Gatsby
2,87,"“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor",Great Gatsby
2,88,Eckleburg.,Great Gatsby
2,89,“Awful.”,Great Gatsby
2,90,“It does her good to get away.”,Great Gatsby
2,91,“Doesn’t her husband object?”,Great Gatsby
2,92,“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so,Great Gatsby
2,93,dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”,Great Gatsby
2,94,So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not,Great Gatsby
2,95,"quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom",Great Gatsby
2,96,deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might,Great Gatsby
2,97,be on the train.,Great Gatsby
2,98,"She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched",Great Gatsby
2,99,tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in,Great Gatsby
2,100,New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a,Great Gatsby
2,101,"moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream",Great Gatsby
2,102,"and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive",Great Gatsby
2,103,"she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,",Great Gatsby
2,104,"lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from",Great Gatsby
2,105,the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she,Great Gatsby
2,106,"turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the",Great Gatsby
2,107,front glass.,Great Gatsby
2,108,"“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get",Great Gatsby
2,109,one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”,Great Gatsby
2,110,We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John,Great Gatsby
2,111,D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very,Great Gatsby
2,112,recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.,Great Gatsby
2,113,"“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the",Great Gatsby
2,114,taxi-window.,Great Gatsby
2,115,"“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”",Great Gatsby
2,116,“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got,Great Gatsby
2,117,that kind?”,Great Gatsby
2,118,"The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and",Great Gatsby
2,119,"drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.",Great Gatsby
2,120,"“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.",Great Gatsby
2,121,"“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment",Great Gatsby
2,122,in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the,Great Gatsby
2,123,brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog,Great Gatsby
2,124,that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”,Great Gatsby
2,125,"“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is",Great Gatsby
2,126,it?”,Great Gatsby
2,127,“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten,Great Gatsby
2,128,dollars.”,Great Gatsby
2,129,The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it,Great Gatsby
2,130,"somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and",Great Gatsby
2,131,"settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the",Great Gatsby
2,132,weatherproof coat with rapture.,Great Gatsby
2,133,“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.,Great Gatsby
2,134,“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”,Great Gatsby
2,135,"“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy",Great Gatsby
2,136,ten more dogs with it.”,Great Gatsby
2,137,"We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the",Great Gatsby
2,138,summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great,Great Gatsby
2,139,flock of white sheep turn the corner.,Great Gatsby
2,140,"“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”",Great Gatsby
2,141,"“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you",Great Gatsby
2,142,"don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”",Great Gatsby
2,143,"“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said",Great Gatsby
2,144,to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”,Great Gatsby
2,145,"“Well, I’d like to, but—”",Great Gatsby
2,146,"We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.",Great Gatsby
2,147,At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of,Great Gatsby
2,148,apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the,Great Gatsby
2,149,"neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other",Great Gatsby
2,150,"purchases, and went haughtily in.",Great Gatsby
2,151,"“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in",Great Gatsby
2,152,"the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”",Great Gatsby
2,153,"The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small",Great Gatsby
2,154,"dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded",Great Gatsby
2,155,to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for,Great Gatsby
2,156,"it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of",Great Gatsby
2,157,ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an,Great Gatsby
2,158,"over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.",Great Gatsby
2,159,"Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a",Great Gatsby
2,160,"bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the",Great Gatsby
2,161,room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with,Great Gatsby
2,162,"a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines",Great Gatsby
2,163,of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant,Great Gatsby
2,164,"elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he",Great Gatsby
2,165,"added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of",Great Gatsby
2,166,which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all,Great Gatsby
2,167,afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked,Great Gatsby
2,168,bureau door.,Great Gatsby
2,169,"I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that",Great Gatsby
2,170,"afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,",Great Gatsby
2,171,although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful,Great Gatsby
2,172,sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the,Great Gatsby
2,173,"telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some",Great Gatsby
2,174,at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both,Great Gatsby
2,175,"disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a",Great Gatsby
2,176,chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the,Great Gatsby
2,177,"whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.",Great Gatsby
2,178,Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called,Great Gatsby
2,179,"each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive",Great Gatsby
2,180,at the apartment door.,Great Gatsby
2,181,"The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,",Great Gatsby
2,182,"with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky",Great Gatsby
2,183,white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more,Great Gatsby
2,184,"rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the",Great Gatsby
2,185,old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about,Great Gatsby
2,186,there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets,Great Gatsby
2,187,jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary,Great Gatsby
2,188,"haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I",Great Gatsby
2,189,wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed,Great Gatsby
2,190,"immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a",Great Gatsby
2,191,girl friend at a hotel.,Great Gatsby
2,192,"Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just",Great Gatsby
2,193,"shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he",Great Gatsby
2,194,was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He,Great Gatsby
2,195,"informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later",Great Gatsby
2,196,that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of,Great Gatsby
2,197,Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His,Great Gatsby
2,198,"wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with",Great Gatsby
2,199,pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven,Great Gatsby
2,200,times since they had been married.,Great Gatsby
2,201,"Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now",Great Gatsby
2,202,"attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,",Great Gatsby
2,203,which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With,Great Gatsby
2,204,the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a,Great Gatsby
2,205,change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage,Great Gatsby
2,206,"was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her",Great Gatsby
2,207,"assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she",Great Gatsby
2,208,"expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be",Great Gatsby
2,209,"revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",Great Gatsby
2,210,"“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of",Great Gatsby
2,211,these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I,Great Gatsby
2,212,"had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me",Great Gatsby
2,213,the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”,Great Gatsby
2,214,“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.,Great Gatsby
2,215,“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own,Great Gatsby
2,216,homes.”,Great Gatsby
2,217,"“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”",Great Gatsby
2,218,Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.,Great Gatsby
2,219,"“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes",Great Gatsby
2,220,when I don’t care what I look like.”,Great Gatsby
2,221,"“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.",Great Gatsby
2,222,McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could,Great Gatsby
2,223,make something of it.”,Great Gatsby
2,224,"We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair",Great Gatsby
2,225,from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.,Great Gatsby
2,226,"McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved",Great Gatsby
2,227,his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.,Great Gatsby
2,228,"“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to",Great Gatsby
2,229,bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of,Great Gatsby
2,230,all the back hair.”,Great Gatsby
2,231,"“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think",Great Gatsby
2,232,it’s—”,Great Gatsby
2,233,"Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,",Great Gatsby
2,234,whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.,Great Gatsby
2,235,"“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and",Great Gatsby
2,236,"mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”",Great Gatsby
2,237,“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair,Great Gatsby
2,238,at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to,Great Gatsby
2,239,keep after them all the time.”,Great Gatsby
2,240,She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to,Great Gatsby
2,241,"the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying",Great Gatsby
2,242,that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.,Great Gatsby
2,243,"“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.",Great Gatsby
2,244,Tom looked at him blankly.,Great Gatsby
2,245,“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”,Great Gatsby
2,246,“Two what?” demanded Tom.,Great Gatsby
2,247,"“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the",Great Gatsby
2,248,other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”,Great Gatsby
2,249,The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.,Great Gatsby
2,250,"“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.",Great Gatsby
2,251,“I live at West Egg.”,Great Gatsby
2,252,“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named,Great Gatsby
2,253,Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”,Great Gatsby
2,254,“I live next door to him.”,Great Gatsby
2,255,"“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s",Great Gatsby
2,256,where all his money comes from.”,Great Gatsby
2,257,“Really?”,Great Gatsby
2,258,She nodded.,Great Gatsby
2,259,“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”,Great Gatsby
2,260,This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.,Great Gatsby
2,261,McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:,Great Gatsby
2,262,"“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but",Great Gatsby
2,263,"Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.",Great Gatsby
2,264,"“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.",Great Gatsby
2,265,All I ask is that they should give me a start.”,Great Gatsby
2,266,"“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as",Great Gatsby
2,267,Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter of,Great Gatsby
2,268,"introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”",Great Gatsby
2,269,"“Do what?” she asked, startled.",Great Gatsby
2,270,"“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can",Great Gatsby
2,271,do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he,Great Gatsby
2,272,"invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like",Great Gatsby
2,273,that.”,Great Gatsby
2,274,Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:,Great Gatsby
2,275,“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”,Great Gatsby
2,276,“Can’t they?”,Great Gatsby
2,277,“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say,Great Gatsby
2,278,"is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them",Great Gatsby
2,279,I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”,Great Gatsby
2,280,“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”,Great Gatsby
2,281,"The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who had",Great Gatsby
2,282,"overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.",Great Gatsby
2,283,"“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.",Great Gatsby
2,284,"“It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and",Great Gatsby
2,285,they don’t believe in divorce.”,Great Gatsby
2,286,"Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the",Great Gatsby
2,287,elaborateness of the lie.,Great Gatsby
2,288,"“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West",Great Gatsby
2,289,to live for a while until it blows over.”,Great Gatsby
2,290,“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”,Great Gatsby
2,291,"“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back",Great Gatsby
2,292,from Monte Carlo.”,Great Gatsby
2,293,“Really.”,Great Gatsby
2,294,“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”,Great Gatsby
2,295,“Stay long?”,Great Gatsby
2,296,"“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of",Great Gatsby
2,297,"Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we",Great Gatsby
2,298,got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an,Great Gatsby
2,299,"awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”",Great Gatsby
2,300,The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the,Great Gatsby
2,301,blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee,Great Gatsby
2,302,called me back into the room.,Great Gatsby
2,303,"“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost",Great Gatsby
2,304,married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was,Great Gatsby
2,305,"below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below",Great Gatsby
2,306,"you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”",Great Gatsby
2,307,"“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,",Great Gatsby
2,308,“at least you didn’t marry him.”,Great Gatsby
2,309,“I know I didn’t.”,Great Gatsby
2,310,"“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the",Great Gatsby
2,311,difference between your case and mine.”,Great Gatsby
2,312,"“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”",Great Gatsby
2,313,Myrtle considered.,Great Gatsby
2,314,"“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said",Great Gatsby
2,315,"finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t",Great Gatsby
2,316,fit to lick my shoe.”,Great Gatsby
2,317,"“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.",Great Gatsby
2,318,“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy,Great Gatsby
2,319,about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that,Great Gatsby
2,320,man there.”,Great Gatsby
2,321,"She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I",Great Gatsby
2,322,tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.,Great Gatsby
2,323,“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made,Great Gatsby
2,324,"a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and",Great Gatsby
2,325,"never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he",Great Gatsby
2,326,"was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever",Great Gatsby
2,327,heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to,Great Gatsby
2,328,beat the band all afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
2,329,"“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me.",Great Gatsby
2,330,“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the,Great Gatsby
2,331,first sweetie she ever had.”,Great Gatsby
2,332,The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all,Great Gatsby
2,333,"present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at",Great Gatsby
2,334,all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated,Great Gatsby
2,335,"sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to",Great Gatsby
2,336,"get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,",Great Gatsby
2,337,"but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident",Great Gatsby
2,338,"argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet",Great Gatsby
2,339,high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed,Great Gatsby
2,340,their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening,Great Gatsby
2,341,"streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and",Great Gatsby
2,342,"without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible",Great Gatsby
2,343,variety of life.,Great Gatsby
2,344,"Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath",Great Gatsby
2,345,poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.,Great Gatsby
2,346,“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the,Great Gatsby
2,347,last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my,Great Gatsby
2,348,sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather,Great Gatsby
2,349,"shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked",Great Gatsby
2,350,at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his,Great Gatsby
2,351,"head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white",Great Gatsby
2,352,"shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call",Great Gatsby
2,353,"a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into",Great Gatsby
2,354,a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway,Great Gatsby
2,355,"train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live",Great Gatsby
2,356,forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”,Great Gatsby
2,357,She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial,Great Gatsby
2,358,laughter.,Great Gatsby
2,359,"“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m",Great Gatsby
2,360,through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to,Great Gatsby
2,361,"make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave,",Great Gatsby
2,362,"and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where",Great Gatsby
2,363,"you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s",Great Gatsby
2,364,grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t,Great Gatsby
2,365,forget all the things I got to do.”,Great Gatsby
2,366,It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch,Great Gatsby
2,367,and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists,Great Gatsby
2,368,"clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out",Great Gatsby
2,369,my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that,Great Gatsby
2,370,had worried me all the afternoon.,Great Gatsby
2,371,The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes,Great Gatsby
2,372,"through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People",Great Gatsby
2,373,"disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost",Great Gatsby
2,374,"each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet",Great Gatsby
2,375,away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood,Great Gatsby
2,376,"face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson",Great Gatsby
2,377,had any right to mention Daisy’s name.,Great Gatsby
2,378,“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever I,Great Gatsby
2,379,want to! Daisy! Dai—”,Great Gatsby
2,380,"Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his",Great Gatsby
2,381,open hand.,Great Gatsby
2,382,"Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s",Great Gatsby
2,383,"voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of",Great Gatsby
2,384,pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the,Great Gatsby
2,385,door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the,Great Gatsby
2,386,scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled,Great Gatsby
2,387,"here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and",Great Gatsby
2,388,"the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to",Great Gatsby
2,389,spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of,Great Gatsby
2,390,Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.,Great Gatsby
2,391,"Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.",Great Gatsby
2,392,"“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the",Great Gatsby
2,393,elevator.,Great Gatsby
2,394,“Where?”,Great Gatsby
2,395,“Anywhere.”,Great Gatsby
2,396,"“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.",Great Gatsby
2,397,"“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was",Great Gatsby
2,398,touching it.”,Great Gatsby
2,399,"“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”",Great Gatsby
2,400,… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the,Great Gatsby
2,401,"sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.",Great Gatsby
2,402,“Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’n,Great Gatsby
2,403,Bridge …”,Great Gatsby
2,404,Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the,Great Gatsby
2,405,"Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for",Great Gatsby
2,406,the four o’clock train.,Great Gatsby
3,0,There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights.,Great Gatsby
3,1,In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the,Great Gatsby
3,2,whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the,Great Gatsby
3,3,"afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or",Great Gatsby
3,4,taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats,Great Gatsby
3,5,"slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of",Great Gatsby
3,6,"foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties",Great Gatsby
3,7,to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past,Great Gatsby
3,8,"midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to",Great Gatsby
3,9,"meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra",Great Gatsby
3,10,"gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers",Great Gatsby
3,11,"and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.",Great Gatsby
3,12,Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a,Great Gatsby
3,13,fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left,Great Gatsby
3,14,his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in,Great Gatsby
3,15,the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in,Great Gatsby
3,16,half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a,Great Gatsby
3,17,butler’s thumb.,Great Gatsby
3,18,At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several,Great Gatsby
3,19,hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas,Great Gatsby
3,20,"tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with",Great Gatsby
3,21,"glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of",Great Gatsby
3,22,harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark,Great Gatsby
3,23,"gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and",Great Gatsby
3,24,stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that,Great Gatsby
3,25,most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.,Great Gatsby
3,26,"By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,",Great Gatsby
3,27,but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and,Great Gatsby
3,28,"cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have",Great Gatsby
3,29,come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from,Great Gatsby
3,30,"New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and",Great Gatsby
3,31,"salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in",Great Gatsby
3,32,"strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is",Great Gatsby
3,33,"in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden",Great Gatsby
3,34,"outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual",Great Gatsby
3,35,"innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic",Great Gatsby
3,36,meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.,Great Gatsby
3,37,"The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and",Great Gatsby
3,38,"now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of",Great Gatsby
3,39,"voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,",Great Gatsby
3,40,"spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups",Great Gatsby
3,41,"change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the",Great Gatsby
3,42,"same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave",Great Gatsby
3,43,"here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,",Great Gatsby
3,44,"joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,",Great Gatsby
3,45,glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under,Great Gatsby
3,46,the constantly changing light.,Great Gatsby
3,47,"Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail",Great Gatsby
3,48,"out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like",Great Gatsby
3,49,"Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the",Great Gatsby
3,50,"orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a",Great Gatsby
3,51,burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda,Great Gatsby
3,52,Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.,Great Gatsby
3,53,I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one,Great Gatsby
3,54,of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not,Great Gatsby
3,55,invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out,Great Gatsby
3,56,"to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there",Great Gatsby
3,57,"they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they",Great Gatsby
3,58,conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated,Great Gatsby
3,59,with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having,Great Gatsby
3,60,"met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that",Great Gatsby
3,61,was its own ticket of admission.,Great Gatsby
3,62,I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg,Great Gatsby
3,63,blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly,Great Gatsby
3,64,"formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,",Great Gatsby
3,65,"it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen",Great Gatsby
3,66,"me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a",Great Gatsby
3,67,peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay,Great Gatsby
3,68,"Gatsby, in a majestic hand.",Great Gatsby
3,69,Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after,Great Gatsby
3,70,"seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies",Great Gatsby
3,71,of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed,Great Gatsby
3,72,on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of,Great Gatsby
3,73,"young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little",Great Gatsby
3,74,"hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous",Great Gatsby
3,75,Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or,Great Gatsby
3,76,insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the,Great Gatsby
3,77,easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few,Great Gatsby
3,78,words in the right key.,Great Gatsby
3,79,"As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or",Great Gatsby
3,80,three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an,Great Gatsby
3,81,"amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,",Great Gatsby
3,82,that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place,Great Gatsby
3,83,in the garden where a single man could linger without looking,Great Gatsby
3,84,purposeless and alone.,Great Gatsby
3,85,I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when,Great Gatsby
3,86,Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble,Great Gatsby
3,87,"steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous",Great Gatsby
3,88,interest down into the garden.,Great Gatsby
3,89,"Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone",Great Gatsby
3,90,before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.,Great Gatsby
3,91,"“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally",Great Gatsby
3,92,loud across the garden.,Great Gatsby
3,93,"“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up.",Great Gatsby
3,94,“I remembered you lived next door to—”,Great Gatsby
3,95,"She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me",Great Gatsby
3,96,"in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who",Great Gatsby
3,97,stopped at the foot of the steps.,Great Gatsby
3,98,“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”,Great Gatsby
3,99,That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week,Great Gatsby
3,100,before.,Great Gatsby
3,101,"“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we",Great Gatsby
3,102,met you here about a month ago.”,Great Gatsby
3,103,"“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,",Great Gatsby
3,104,but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to,Great Gatsby
3,105,"the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a",Great Gatsby
3,106,"caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we",Great Gatsby
3,107,descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of,Great Gatsby
3,108,"cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a",Great Gatsby
3,109,"table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced",Great Gatsby
3,110,to us as Mr. Mumble.,Great Gatsby
3,111,“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl,Great Gatsby
3,112,beside her.,Great Gatsby
3,113,"“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an",Great Gatsby
3,114,alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for,Great Gatsby
3,115,"you, Lucille?”",Great Gatsby
3,116,"It was for Lucille, too.",Great Gatsby
3,117,"“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always",Great Gatsby
3,118,"have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and",Great Gatsby
3,119,he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from,Great Gatsby
3,120,Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”,Great Gatsby
3,121,“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.,Great Gatsby
3,122,"“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the",Great Gatsby
3,123,bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two,Great Gatsby
3,124,hundred and sixty-five dollars.”,Great Gatsby
3,125,"“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”",Great Gatsby
3,126,said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with,Great Gatsby
3,127,anybody.”,Great Gatsby
3,128,“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.,Great Gatsby
3,129,“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”,Great Gatsby
3,130,The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.,Great Gatsby
3,131,“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”,Great Gatsby
3,132,A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and,Great Gatsby
3,133,listened eagerly.,Great Gatsby
3,134,"“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s",Great Gatsby
3,135,more that he was a German spy during the war.”,Great Gatsby
3,136,One of the men nodded in confirmation.,Great Gatsby
3,137,"“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in",Great Gatsby
3,138,"Germany,” he assured us positively.",Great Gatsby
3,139,"“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in",Great Gatsby
3,140,the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to,Great Gatsby
3,141,her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes,Great Gatsby
3,142,when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”,Great Gatsby
3,143,She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned,Great Gatsby
3,144,and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic,Great Gatsby
3,145,speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those,Great Gatsby
3,146,who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this,Great Gatsby
3,147,world.,Great Gatsby
3,148,The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now,Great Gatsby
3,149,"being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were",Great Gatsby
3,150,spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were,Great Gatsby
3,151,"three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate",Great Gatsby
3,152,"given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that",Great Gatsby
3,153,sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a,Great Gatsby
3,154,"greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had",Great Gatsby
3,155,"preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function",Great Gatsby
3,156,of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg,Great Gatsby
3,157,condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its,Great Gatsby
3,158,spectroscopic gaiety.,Great Gatsby
3,159,"“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and",Great Gatsby
3,160,inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”,Great Gatsby
3,161,"We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I",Great Gatsby
3,162,"had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The",Great Gatsby
3,163,"undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.",Great Gatsby
3,164,"The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not",Great Gatsby
3,165,"there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t",Great Gatsby
3,166,"on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and",Great Gatsby
3,167,"walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,",Great Gatsby
3,168,and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.,Great Gatsby
3,169,"A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was",Great Gatsby
3,170,"sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with",Great Gatsby
3,171,unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he,Great Gatsby
3,172,wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.,Great Gatsby
3,173,“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.,Great Gatsby
3,174,“About what?”,Great Gatsby
3,175,He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.,Great Gatsby
3,176,“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I,Great Gatsby
3,177,ascertained. They’re real.”,Great Gatsby
3,178,“The books?”,Great Gatsby
3,179,He nodded.,Great Gatsby
3,180,“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice,Great Gatsby
3,181,"durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.  Pages",Great Gatsby
3,182,and—Here! Lemme show you.”,Great Gatsby
3,183,"Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and",Great Gatsby
3,184,returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.,Great Gatsby
3,185,“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed,Great Gatsby
3,186,matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a,Great Gatsby
3,187,"triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,",Great Gatsby
3,188,too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”,Great Gatsby
3,189,"He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,",Great Gatsby
3,190,muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable,Great Gatsby
3,191,to collapse.,Great Gatsby
3,192,“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought.,Great Gatsby
3,193,Most people were brought.”,Great Gatsby
3,194,"Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.",Great Gatsby
3,195,"“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud",Great Gatsby
3,196,Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been,Great Gatsby
3,197,"drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit",Great Gatsby
3,198,in a library.”,Great Gatsby
3,199,“Has it?”,Great Gatsby
3,200,"“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour.",Great Gatsby
3,201,Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”,Great Gatsby
3,202,“You told us.”,Great Gatsby
3,203,We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.,Great Gatsby
3,204,There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing,Great Gatsby
3,205,"young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples",Great Gatsby
3,206,"holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the",Great Gatsby
3,207,corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or,Great Gatsby
3,208,relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the,Great Gatsby
3,209,traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had,Great Gatsby
3,210,"sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and",Great Gatsby
3,211,"between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,",Great Gatsby
3,212,"while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A",Great Gatsby
3,213,"pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a",Great Gatsby
3,214,"baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than",Great Gatsby
3,215,"finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was",Great Gatsby
3,216,"a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny",Great Gatsby
3,217,drip of the banjoes on the lawn.,Great Gatsby
3,218,I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man,Great Gatsby
3,219,"of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the",Great Gatsby
3,220,slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying,Great Gatsby
3,221,"myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene",Great Gatsby
3,222,"had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and",Great Gatsby
3,223,profound.,Great Gatsby
3,224,At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.,Great Gatsby
3,225,"“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First",Great Gatsby
3,226,Division during the war?”,Great Gatsby
3,227,“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”,Great Gatsby
3,228,“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen,Great Gatsby
3,229,you somewhere before.”,Great Gatsby
3,230,"We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.",Great Gatsby
3,231,"Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just",Great Gatsby
3,232,"bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.",Great Gatsby
3,233,"“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”",Great Gatsby
3,234,“What time?”,Great Gatsby
3,235,“Any time that suits you best.”,Great Gatsby
3,236,It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked,Great Gatsby
3,237,around and smiled.,Great Gatsby
3,238,“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.,Great Gatsby
3,239,“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an,Great Gatsby
3,240,unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over,Great Gatsby
3,241,"there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and",Great Gatsby
3,242,this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”,Great Gatsby
3,243,For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.,Great Gatsby
3,244,"“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.",Great Gatsby
3,245,"“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”",Great Gatsby
3,246,"“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”",Great Gatsby
3,247,He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one,Great Gatsby
3,248,"of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that",Great Gatsby
3,249,you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to,Great Gatsby
3,250,"face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on",Great Gatsby
3,251,you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you,Great Gatsby
3,252,"just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you",Great Gatsby
3,253,"would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had",Great Gatsby
3,254,"precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to",Great Gatsby
3,255,convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an,Great Gatsby
3,256,"elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate",Great Gatsby
3,257,formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he,Great Gatsby
3,258,introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his,Great Gatsby
3,259,words with care.,Great Gatsby
3,260,Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler,Great Gatsby
3,261,hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him,Great Gatsby
3,262,on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of,Great Gatsby
3,263,us in turn.,Great Gatsby
3,264,"“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.",Great Gatsby
3,265,“Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”,Great Gatsby
3,266,When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure,Great Gatsby
3,267,her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid,Great Gatsby
3,268,and corpulent person in his middle years.,Great Gatsby
3,269,“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”,Great Gatsby
3,270,“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”,Great Gatsby
3,271,"“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”",Great Gatsby
3,272,"“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.",Great Gatsby
3,273,"“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”",Great Gatsby
3,274,"A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next",Great Gatsby
3,275,remark it faded away.,Great Gatsby
3,276,"“However, I don’t believe it.”",Great Gatsby
3,277,“Why not?”,Great Gatsby
3,278,"“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”",Great Gatsby
3,279,Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he,Great Gatsby
3,280,"killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would",Great Gatsby
3,281,have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from,Great Gatsby
3,282,the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That,Great Gatsby
3,283,was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial,Great Gatsby
3,284,inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and,Great Gatsby
3,285,buy a palace on Long Island Sound.,Great Gatsby
3,286,"“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject",Great Gatsby
3,287,with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties.,Great Gatsby
3,288,They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”,Great Gatsby
3,289,"There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra",Great Gatsby
3,290,leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.,Great Gatsby
3,291,"“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are",Great Gatsby
3,292,"going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which",Great Gatsby
3,293,attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the,Great Gatsby
3,294,papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial,Great Gatsby
3,295,"condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody",Great Gatsby
3,296,laughed.,Great Gatsby
3,297,"“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s",Great Gatsby
3,298,Jazz History of the World!’ ”,Great Gatsby
3,299,"The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it",Great Gatsby
3,300,"began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and",Great Gatsby
3,301,looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin,Great Gatsby
3,302,was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as,Great Gatsby
3,303,though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about,Great Gatsby
3,304,him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him,Great Gatsby
3,305,"off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as",Great Gatsby
3,306,the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”,Great Gatsby
3,307,"was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a",Great Gatsby
3,308,"puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into",Great Gatsby
3,309,"men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their",Great Gatsby
3,310,"falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched",Great Gatsby
3,311,"Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s",Great Gatsby
3,312,head for one link.,Great Gatsby
3,313,“I beg your pardon.”,Great Gatsby
3,314,Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.,Great Gatsby
3,315,"“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would",Great Gatsby
3,316,like to speak to you alone.”,Great Gatsby
3,317,“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.,Great Gatsby
3,318,"“Yes, madame.”",Great Gatsby
3,319,"She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and",Great Gatsby
3,320,followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her,Great Gatsby
3,321,"evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a",Great Gatsby
3,322,jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk,Great Gatsby
3,323,"upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.",Great Gatsby
3,324,I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and,Great Gatsby
3,325,"intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which",Great Gatsby
3,326,"overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now",Great Gatsby
3,327,"engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who",Great Gatsby
3,328,"implored me to join him, I went inside.",Great Gatsby
3,329,The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was,Great Gatsby
3,330,"playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady",Great Gatsby
3,331,"from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of",Great Gatsby
3,332,"champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,",Great Gatsby
3,333,"that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was",Great Gatsby
3,334,weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with,Great Gatsby
3,335,"gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering",Great Gatsby
3,336,"soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for",Great Gatsby
3,337,when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they,Great Gatsby
3,338,"assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow",Great Gatsby
3,339,black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes,Great Gatsby
3,340,"on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and",Great Gatsby
3,341,went off into a deep vinous sleep.,Great Gatsby
3,342,"“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a",Great Gatsby
3,343,girl at my elbow.,Great Gatsby
3,344,I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights,Great Gatsby
3,345,"with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet",Great Gatsby
3,346,"from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was",Great Gatsby
3,347,"talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after",Great Gatsby
3,348,attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent,Great Gatsby
3,349,"way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals",Great Gatsby
3,350,"she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:",Great Gatsby
3,351,“You promised!” into his ear.,Great Gatsby
3,352,The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall,Great Gatsby
3,353,was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly,Great Gatsby
3,354,indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in,Great Gatsby
3,355,slightly raised voices.,Great Gatsby
3,356,“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”,Great Gatsby
3,357,“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”,Great Gatsby
3,358,“We’re always the first ones to leave.”,Great Gatsby
3,359,“So are we.”,Great Gatsby
3,360,"“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.",Great Gatsby
3,361,“The orchestra left half an hour ago.”,Great Gatsby
3,362,In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond,Great Gatsby
3,363,"credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives",Great Gatsby
3,364,"were lifted, kicking, into the night.",Great Gatsby
3,365,As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and,Great Gatsby
3,366,Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last,Great Gatsby
3,367,"word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into",Great Gatsby
3,368,formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.,Great Gatsby
3,369,"Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she",Great Gatsby
3,370,lingered for a moment to shake hands.,Great Gatsby
3,371,"“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long",Great Gatsby
3,372,were we in there?”,Great Gatsby
3,373,"“Why, about an hour.”",Great Gatsby
3,374,"“It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I",Great Gatsby
3,375,wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully,Great Gatsby
3,376,in my face. “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of,Great Gatsby
3,377,Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she,Great Gatsby
3,378,talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her,Great Gatsby
3,379,party at the door.,Great Gatsby
3,380,"Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I",Great Gatsby
3,381,"joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I",Great Gatsby
3,382,wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to,Great Gatsby
3,383,apologize for not having known him in the garden.,Great Gatsby
3,384,"“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another",Great Gatsby
3,385,"thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity",Great Gatsby
3,386,than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t,Great Gatsby
3,387,"forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine",Great Gatsby
3,388,o’clock.”,Great Gatsby
3,389,"Then the butler, behind his shoulder:",Great Gatsby
3,390,"“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”",Great Gatsby
3,391,"“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”",Great Gatsby
3,392,“Good night.”,Great Gatsby
3,393,“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant,Great Gatsby
3,394,"significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired",Great Gatsby
3,395,"it all the time. “Good night, old sport … Good night.”",Great Gatsby
3,396,But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite,Great Gatsby
3,397,over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a,Great Gatsby
3,398,"bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side",Great Gatsby
3,399,"up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had",Great Gatsby
3,400,left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall,Great Gatsby
3,401,"accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting",Great Gatsby
3,402,"considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,",Great Gatsby
3,403,"as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din",Great Gatsby
3,404,"from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to",Great Gatsby
3,405,the already violent confusion of the scene.,Great Gatsby
3,406,A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in,Great Gatsby
3,407,"the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the",Great Gatsby
3,408,"tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.",Great Gatsby
3,409,“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”,Great Gatsby
3,410,"The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the",Great Gatsby
3,411,"unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of",Great Gatsby
3,412,Gatsby’s library.,Great Gatsby
3,413,“How’d it happen?”,Great Gatsby
3,414,He shrugged his shoulders.,Great Gatsby
3,415,"“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.",Great Gatsby
3,416,“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”,Great Gatsby
3,417,"“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole",Great Gatsby
3,418,matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It,Great Gatsby
3,419,"happened, and that’s all I know.”",Great Gatsby
3,420,"“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”",Great Gatsby
3,421,"“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even",Great Gatsby
3,422,trying.”,Great Gatsby
3,423,An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.,Great Gatsby
3,424,“Do you want to commit suicide?”,Great Gatsby
3,425,“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”,Great Gatsby
3,426,"“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving.",Great Gatsby
3,427,There’s another man in the car.”,Great Gatsby
3,428,The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained,Great Gatsby
3,429,“Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was,Great Gatsby
3,430,"now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened",Great Gatsby
3,431,"wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a",Great Gatsby
3,432,"pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively",Great Gatsby
3,433,at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.,Great Gatsby
3,434,Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant,Great Gatsby
3,435,"groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment",Great Gatsby
3,436,before he perceived the man in the duster.,Great Gatsby
3,437,“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”,Great Gatsby
3,438,“Look!”,Great Gatsby
3,439,Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it,Great Gatsby
3,440,"for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it",Great Gatsby
3,441,had dropped from the sky.,Great Gatsby
3,442,"“It came off,” someone explained.",Great Gatsby
3,443,He nodded.,Great Gatsby
3,444,“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”,Great Gatsby
3,445,"A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,",Great Gatsby
3,446,he remarked in a determined voice:,Great Gatsby
3,447,“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”,Great Gatsby
3,448,"At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,",Great Gatsby
3,449,explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any,Great Gatsby
3,450,physical bond.,Great Gatsby
3,451,"“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”",Great Gatsby
3,452,“But the wheel’s off!”,Great Gatsby
3,453,He hesitated.,Great Gatsby
3,454,"“No harm in trying,” he said.",Great Gatsby
3,455,The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and,Great Gatsby
3,456,cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a,Great Gatsby
3,457,"moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,",Great Gatsby
3,458,and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.,Great Gatsby
3,459,A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great,Great Gatsby
3,460,"doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who",Great Gatsby
3,461,"stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",Great Gatsby
3,462,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
3,463,"Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the",Great Gatsby
3,464,impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were,Great Gatsby
3,465,"all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events",Great Gatsby
3,466,"in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me",Great Gatsby
3,467,infinitely less than my personal affairs.,Great Gatsby
3,468,Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my,Great Gatsby
3,469,shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York,Great Gatsby
3,470,to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen,Great Gatsby
3,471,"by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded",Great Gatsby
3,472,restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I,Great Gatsby
3,473,even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and,Great Gatsby
3,474,"worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing",Great Gatsby
3,475,"mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I",Great Gatsby
3,476,let it blow quietly away.,Great Gatsby
3,477,I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the,Great Gatsby
3,478,gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and,Great Gatsby
3,479,studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There,Great Gatsby
3,480,"were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the",Great Gatsby
3,481,"library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was",Great Gatsby
3,482,"mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,",Great Gatsby
3,483,and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.,Great Gatsby
3,484,"I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,",Great Gatsby
3,485,and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and,Great Gatsby
3,486,machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue,Great Gatsby
3,487,and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few,Great Gatsby
3,488,"minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever",Great Gatsby
3,489,"know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their",Great Gatsby
3,490,"apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and",Great Gatsby
3,491,smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm,Great Gatsby
3,492,darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting,Great Gatsby
3,493,"loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who",Great Gatsby
3,494,loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary,Great Gatsby
3,495,"restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant",Great Gatsby
3,496,moments of night and life.,Great Gatsby
3,497,"Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined",Great Gatsby
3,498,"five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I",Great Gatsby
3,499,felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they,Great Gatsby
3,500,"waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,",Great Gatsby
3,501,and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining,Great Gatsby
3,502,"that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate",Great Gatsby
3,503,"excitement, I wished them well.",Great Gatsby
3,504,"For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I",Great Gatsby
3,505,"found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,",Great Gatsby
3,506,"because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it",Great Gatsby
3,507,"was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of",Great Gatsby
3,508,tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world,Great Gatsby
3,509,"concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,",Great Gatsby
3,510,even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it,Great Gatsby
3,511,"was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a",Great Gatsby
3,512,"borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about",Great Gatsby
3,513,it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me,Great Gatsby
3,514,that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a,Great Gatsby
3,515,row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved,Great Gatsby
3,516,her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached,Great Gatsby
3,517,the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his,Great Gatsby
3,518,"statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been",Great Gatsby
3,519,mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.,Great Gatsby
3,520,"Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw",Great Gatsby
3,521,that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence,Great Gatsby
3,522,from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.,Great Gatsby
3,523,"She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this",Great Gatsby
3,524,"unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she",Great Gatsby
3,525,"was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to",Great Gatsby
3,526,"the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.",Great Gatsby
3,527,It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you,Great Gatsby
3,528,"never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on",Great Gatsby
3,529,that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving,Great Gatsby
3,530,a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our,Great Gatsby
3,531,fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.,Great Gatsby
3,532,"“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more",Great Gatsby
3,533,"careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”",Great Gatsby
3,534,“I am careful.”,Great Gatsby
3,535,"“No, you’re not.”",Great Gatsby
3,536,"“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.",Great Gatsby
3,537,“What’s that got to do with it?”,Great Gatsby
3,538,"“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an",Great Gatsby
3,539,accident.”,Great Gatsby
3,540,“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”,Great Gatsby
3,541,"“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s",Great Gatsby
3,542,why I like you.”,Great Gatsby
3,543,"Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had",Great Gatsby
3,544,"deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved",Great Gatsby
3,545,her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as,Great Gatsby
3,546,"brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself",Great Gatsby
3,547,definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once,Great Gatsby
3,548,"a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was",Great Gatsby
3,549,"how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of",Great Gatsby
3,550,perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague,Great Gatsby
3,551,understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.,Great Gatsby
3,552,"Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and",Great Gatsby
3,553,this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever,Great Gatsby
3,554,known.,Great Gatsby
4,0,"On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,",Great Gatsby
4,1,the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled,Great Gatsby
4,2,hilariously on his lawn.,Great Gatsby
4,3,"“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between",Great Gatsby
4,4,his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found,Great Gatsby
4,5,out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the,Great Gatsby
4,6,"devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there",Great Gatsby
4,7,crystal glass.”,Great Gatsby
4,8,Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of,Great Gatsby
4,9,those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable,Great Gatsby
4,10,"now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect",Great Gatsby
4,11,"July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will",Great Gatsby
4,12,give you a better impression than my generalities of those who,Great Gatsby
4,13,accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of,Great Gatsby
4,14,knowing nothing whatever about him.,Great Gatsby
4,15,"From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a",Great Gatsby
4,16,"man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who",Great Gatsby
4,17,was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie,Great Gatsby
4,18,"Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a",Great Gatsby
4,19,corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came,Great Gatsby
4,20,near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and,Great Gatsby
4,21,"Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned",Great Gatsby
4,22,cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.,Great Gatsby
4,23,"Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,",Great Gatsby
4,24,"in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the",Great Gatsby
4,25,garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.,Great Gatsby
4,26,"R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the",Great Gatsby
4,27,Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he,Great Gatsby
4,28,"went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that",Great Gatsby
4,29,Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies,Great Gatsby
4,30,"came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice",Great Gatsby
4,31,"A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and",Great Gatsby
4,32,Beluga’s girls.,Great Gatsby
4,33,From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and,Great Gatsby
4,34,"Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who",Great Gatsby
4,35,"controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don",Great Gatsby
4,36,"S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the",Great Gatsby
4,37,movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.,Great Gatsby
4,38,"Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his",Great Gatsby
4,39,"wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.",Great Gatsby
4,40,(“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to,Great Gatsby
4,41,"gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was",Great Gatsby
4,42,cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably,Great Gatsby
4,43,next day.,Great Gatsby
4,44,A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as,Great Gatsby
4,45,“the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people,Great Gatsby
4,46,there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George,Great Gatsby
4,47,Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the,Great Gatsby
4,48,Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and,Great Gatsby
4,49,the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the,Great Gatsby
4,50,"Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who",Great Gatsby
4,51,killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.,Great Gatsby
4,52,Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite,Great Gatsby
4,53,"the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with",Great Gatsby
4,54,another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have,Great Gatsby
4,55,"forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria",Great Gatsby
4,56,"or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names",Great Gatsby
4,57,of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American,Great Gatsby
4,58,"capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves",Great Gatsby
4,59,to be.,Great Gatsby
4,60,In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came,Great Gatsby
4,61,"there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had",Great Gatsby
4,62,"his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,",Great Gatsby
4,63,"his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of",Great Gatsby
4,64,"the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be",Great Gatsby
4,65,"her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and",Great Gatsby
4,66,"whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.",Great Gatsby
4,67,All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.,Great Gatsby
4,68,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
4,69,"At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car",Great Gatsby
4,70,lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody,Great Gatsby
4,71,from its three-noted horn.,Great Gatsby
4,72,"It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of",Great Gatsby
4,73,"his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,",Great Gatsby
4,74,made frequent use of his beach.,Great Gatsby
4,75,"“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I",Great Gatsby
4,76,thought we’d ride up together.”,Great Gatsby
4,77,He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that,Great Gatsby
4,78,"resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,",Great Gatsby
4,79,"I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,",Great Gatsby
4,80,"with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality",Great Gatsby
4,81,was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape,Great Gatsby
4,82,of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping,Great Gatsby
4,83,foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.,Great Gatsby
4,84,He saw me looking with admiration at his car.,Great Gatsby
4,85,"“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better",Great Gatsby
4,86,view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”,Great Gatsby
4,87,"I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright",Great Gatsby
4,88,"with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with",Great Gatsby
4,89,"triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with",Great Gatsby
4,90,a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down,Great Gatsby
4,91,"behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,",Great Gatsby
4,92,we started to town.,Great Gatsby
4,93,I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and,Great Gatsby
4,94,"found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first",Great Gatsby
4,95,"impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had",Great Gatsby
4,96,gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an,Great Gatsby
4,97,elaborate roadhouse next door.,Great Gatsby
4,98,And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg,Great Gatsby
4,99,village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished,Great Gatsby
4,100,and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured,Great Gatsby
4,101,suit.,Great Gatsby
4,102,"“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your",Great Gatsby
4,103,"opinion of me, anyhow?”",Great Gatsby
4,104,"A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that",Great Gatsby
4,105,question deserves.,Great Gatsby
4,106,"“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.",Great Gatsby
4,107,“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you,Great Gatsby
4,108,hear.”,Great Gatsby
4,109,So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation,Great Gatsby
4,110,in his halls.,Great Gatsby
4,111,“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine,Great Gatsby
4,112,retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the,Great Gatsby
4,113,Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at,Great Gatsby
4,114,"Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many",Great Gatsby
4,115,years. It is a family tradition.”,Great Gatsby
4,116,He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he,Great Gatsby
4,117,"was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed",Great Gatsby
4,118,"it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with",Great Gatsby
4,119,"this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if",Great Gatsby
4,120,"there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.",Great Gatsby
4,121,“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.,Great Gatsby
4,122,“San Francisco.”,Great Gatsby
4,123,“I see.”,Great Gatsby
4,124,“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”,Great Gatsby
4,125,"His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a",Great Gatsby
4,126,clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling,Great Gatsby
4,127,"my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.",Great Gatsby
4,128,“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of,Great Gatsby
4,129,"Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting",Great Gatsby
4,130,"big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to",Great Gatsby
4,131,forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”,Great Gatsby
4,132,With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very,Great Gatsby
4,133,phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that,Great Gatsby
4,134,of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued,Great Gatsby
4,135,a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.,Great Gatsby
4,136,"“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very",Great Gatsby
4,137,"hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a",Great Gatsby
4,138,commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I,Great Gatsby
4,139,took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there,Great Gatsby
4,140,was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t,Great Gatsby
4,141,"advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty",Great Gatsby
4,142,"men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last",Great Gatsby
4,143,they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of,Great Gatsby
4,144,"dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave",Great Gatsby
4,145,"me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the",Great Gatsby
4,146,Adriatic Sea!”,Great Gatsby
4,147,Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his,Great Gatsby
4,148,smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and,Great Gatsby
4,149,sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It,Great Gatsby
4,150,appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had,Great Gatsby
4,151,elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My,Great Gatsby
4,152,incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming,Great Gatsby
4,153,hastily through a dozen magazines.,Great Gatsby
4,154,"He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,",Great Gatsby
4,155,fell into my palm.,Great Gatsby
4,156,“That’s the one from Montenegro.”,Great Gatsby
4,157,"To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di",Great Gatsby
4,158,"Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”",Great Gatsby
4,159,“Turn it.”,Great Gatsby
4,160,"“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”",Great Gatsby
4,161,“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It,Great Gatsby
4,162,was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of,Great Gatsby
4,163,Doncaster.”,Great Gatsby
4,164,It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an,Great Gatsby

4,166,"looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",Great Gatsby
4,167,Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace,Great Gatsby
4,168,"on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with",Great Gatsby
4,169,"their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.",Great Gatsby
4,170,"“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his",Great Gatsby
4,171,"souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something",Great Gatsby
4,172,"about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,",Great Gatsby
4,173,I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there,Great Gatsby
4,174,trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.,Great Gatsby
4,175,“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
4,176,“At lunch?”,Great Gatsby
4,177,"“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss",Great Gatsby
4,178,Baker to tea.”,Great Gatsby
4,179,“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”,Great Gatsby
4,180,"“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak",Great Gatsby
4,181,to you about this matter.”,Great Gatsby
4,182,"I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more",Great Gatsby
4,183,annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to,Great Gatsby
4,184,discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something,Great Gatsby
4,185,"utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon",Great Gatsby
4,186,his overpopulated lawn.,Great Gatsby
4,187,He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared,Great Gatsby
4,188,"the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of",Great Gatsby
4,189,"red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with",Great Gatsby
4,190,"the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.",Great Gatsby
4,191,"Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a",Great Gatsby
4,192,glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting,Great Gatsby
4,193,vitality as we went by.,Great Gatsby
4,194,With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half,Great Gatsby
4,195,"Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated",Great Gatsby
4,196,"I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic",Great Gatsby
4,197,policeman rode alongside.,Great Gatsby
4,198,"“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white",Great Gatsby
4,199,"card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.",Great Gatsby
4,200,"“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next",Great Gatsby
4,201,"time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”",Great Gatsby
4,202,“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”,Great Gatsby
4,203,"“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a",Great Gatsby
4,204,Christmas card every year.”,Great Gatsby
4,205,"Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a",Great Gatsby
4,206,"constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across",Great Gatsby
4,207,the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of,Great Gatsby
4,208,nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always,Great Gatsby
4,209,"the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the",Great Gatsby
4,210,mystery and the beauty in the world.,Great Gatsby
4,211,"A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two",Great Gatsby
4,212,"carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for",Great Gatsby
4,213,friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short,Great Gatsby
4,214,"upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of",Great Gatsby
4,215,Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we,Great Gatsby
4,216,"crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white",Great Gatsby
4,217,"chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I",Great Gatsby
4,218,laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in,Great Gatsby
4,219,haughty rivalry.,Great Gatsby
4,220,"“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;",Great Gatsby
4,221,“anything at all …”,Great Gatsby
4,222,"Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",Great Gatsby
4,223,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
4,224,Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby,Great Gatsby
4,225,"for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes",Great Gatsby
4,226,"picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.",Great Gatsby
4,227,"“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”",Great Gatsby
4,228,"A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two",Great Gatsby
4,229,fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a,Great Gatsby
4,230,moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.,Great Gatsby
4,231,"“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand",Great Gatsby
4,232,"earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”",Great Gatsby
4,233,“What?” I inquired politely.,Great Gatsby
4,234,"But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and",Great Gatsby
4,235,covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.,Great Gatsby
4,236,"“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,",Great Gatsby
4,237,don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and,Great Gatsby
4,238,there.”,Great Gatsby
4,239,Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the,Great Gatsby
4,240,"restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was",Great Gatsby
4,241,starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.,Great Gatsby
4,242,“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.,Great Gatsby
4,243,"“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the",Great Gatsby
4,244,presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street,Great Gatsby
4,245,better!”,Great Gatsby
4,246,"“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too",Great Gatsby
4,247,hot over there.”,Great Gatsby
4,248,"“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”",Great Gatsby
4,249,“What place is that?” I asked.,Great Gatsby
4,250,“The old Metropole.”,Great Gatsby
4,251,"“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with",Great Gatsby
4,252,faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t,Great Gatsby
4,253,forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It,Great Gatsby
4,254,"was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all",Great Gatsby
4,255,evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a,Great Gatsby
4,256,funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All,Great Gatsby
4,257,"right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his",Great Gatsby
4,258,chair.,Great Gatsby
4,259,"“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t",Great Gatsby
4,260,"you, so help me, move outside this room.’",Great Gatsby
4,261,"“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the",Great Gatsby
4,262,blinds we’d of seen daylight.”,Great Gatsby
4,263,“Did he go?” I asked innocently.,Great Gatsby
4,264,“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He,Great Gatsby
4,265,turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away,Great Gatsby
4,266,"my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three",Great Gatsby
4,267,times in his full belly and drove away.”,Great Gatsby
4,268,"“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.",Great Gatsby
4,269,"“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.",Great Gatsby
4,270,“I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”,Great Gatsby
4,271,The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered,Great Gatsby
4,272,for me:,Great Gatsby
4,273,"“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”",Great Gatsby
4,274,“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.,Great Gatsby
4,275,“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other,Great Gatsby
4,276,time.”,Great Gatsby
4,277,"“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”",Great Gatsby
4,278,"A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more",Great Gatsby
4,279,"sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with",Great Gatsby
4,280,"ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around",Great Gatsby
4,281,the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people,Great Gatsby
4,282,"directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have",Great Gatsby
4,283,taken one short glance beneath our own table.,Great Gatsby
4,284,"“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I",Great Gatsby
4,285,made you a little angry this morning in the car.”,Great Gatsby
4,286,"There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.",Great Gatsby
4,287,"“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you",Great Gatsby
4,288,won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got,Great Gatsby
4,289,to come through Miss Baker?”,Great Gatsby
4,290,"“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a great",Great Gatsby
4,291,"sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all",Great Gatsby
4,292,right.”,Great Gatsby
4,293,"Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,",Great Gatsby
4,294,leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.,Great Gatsby
4,295,"“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his",Great Gatsby
4,296,"eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect",Great Gatsby
4,297,gentleman.”,Great Gatsby
4,298,“Yes.”,Great Gatsby
4,299,“He’s an Oggsford man.”,Great Gatsby
4,300,“Oh!”,Great Gatsby
4,301,“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”,Great Gatsby
4,302,“I’ve heard of it.”,Great Gatsby
4,303,“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”,Great Gatsby
4,304,“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.,Great Gatsby
4,305,"“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure",Great Gatsby
4,306,of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a,Great Gatsby
4,307,man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to,Great Gatsby
4,308,myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce,Great Gatsby
4,309,to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my,Great Gatsby
4,310,cuff buttons.”,Great Gatsby
4,311,"I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of",Great Gatsby
4,312,oddly familiar pieces of ivory.,Great Gatsby
4,313,"“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.",Great Gatsby
4,314,“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”,Great Gatsby
4,315,"“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very",Great Gatsby
4,316,careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s,Great Gatsby
4,317,wife.”,Great Gatsby
4,318,When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and,Great Gatsby
4,319,sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his,Great Gatsby
4,320,feet.,Great Gatsby
4,321,"“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you",Great Gatsby
4,322,two young men before I outstay my welcome.”,Great Gatsby
4,323,"“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem",Great Gatsby
4,324,raised his hand in a sort of benediction.,Great Gatsby
4,325,"“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced",Great Gatsby
4,326,solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies,Great Gatsby
4,327,and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his,Great Gatsby
4,328,"hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on",Great Gatsby
4,329,you any longer.”,Great Gatsby
4,330,As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I,Great Gatsby
4,331,wondered if I had said anything to offend him.,Great Gatsby
4,332,"“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is",Great Gatsby
4,333,one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a,Great Gatsby
4,334,denizen of Broadway.”,Great Gatsby
4,335,"“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”",Great Gatsby
4,336,“No.”,Great Gatsby
4,337,“A dentist?”,Great Gatsby
4,338,"“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added,",Great Gatsby
4,339,coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”,Great Gatsby
4,340,“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.,Great Gatsby
4,341,"The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s",Great Gatsby
4,342,"Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I",Great Gatsby
4,343,"would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of",Great Gatsby
4,344,some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could,Great Gatsby
4,345,start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the,Great Gatsby
4,346,single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.,Great Gatsby
4,347,“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.,Great Gatsby
4,348,“He just saw the opportunity.”,Great Gatsby
4,349,“Why isn’t he in jail?”,Great Gatsby
4,350,"“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”",Great Gatsby
4,351,I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I,Great Gatsby
4,352,caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.,Great Gatsby
4,353,"“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to",Great Gatsby
4,354,someone.”,Great Gatsby
4,355,When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our,Great Gatsby
4,356,direction.,Great Gatsby
4,357,“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you,Great Gatsby
4,358,haven’t called up.”,Great Gatsby
4,359,"“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”",Great Gatsby
4,360,"They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of",Great Gatsby
4,361,embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.,Great Gatsby
4,362,"“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to",Great Gatsby
4,363,come up this far to eat?”,Great Gatsby
4,364,“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”,Great Gatsby
4,365,"I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",Great Gatsby

4,367,One October day in nineteen-seventeen—,Great Gatsby
4,368,"(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a",Great Gatsby
4,369,straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel),Great Gatsby
4,370,"—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks",Great Gatsby
4,371,and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on,Great Gatsby
4,372,shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the,Great Gatsby
4,373,soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the,Great Gatsby
4,374,"wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in",Great Gatsby
4,375,"front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,",Great Gatsby
4,376,in a disapproving way.,Great Gatsby
4,377,The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to,Great Gatsby
4,378,"Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and",Great Gatsby
4,379,by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She,Great Gatsby
4,380,"dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long",Great Gatsby
4,381,the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp,Great Gatsby
4,382,Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that,Great Gatsby
4,383,"night. “Anyways, for an hour!”",Great Gatsby
4,384,When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was,Great Gatsby
4,385,"beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had",Great Gatsby
4,386,never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she,Great Gatsby
4,387,didn’t see me until I was five feet away.,Great Gatsby
4,388,"“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”",Great Gatsby
4,389,"I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the",Great Gatsby
4,390,older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red,Great Gatsby
4,391,"Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she",Great Gatsby
4,392,couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was,Great Gatsby
4,393,"speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at",Great Gatsby
4,394,"sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the",Great Gatsby
4,395,"incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on",Great Gatsby
4,396,him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I,Great Gatsby
4,397,didn’t realize it was the same man.,Great Gatsby
4,398,That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux,Great Gatsby
4,399,"myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very",Great Gatsby
4,400,often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone,Great Gatsby
4,401,at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had,Great Gatsby
4,402,found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say,Great Gatsby
4,403,goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually,Great Gatsby
4,404,"prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for",Great Gatsby
4,405,several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any,Great Gatsby
4,406,"more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,",Great Gatsby
4,407,who couldn’t get into the army at all.,Great Gatsby
4,408,"By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début",Great Gatsby
4,409,"after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a",Great Gatsby
4,410,"man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,",Great Gatsby
4,411,with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He,Great Gatsby
4,412,"came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a",Great Gatsby
4,413,"whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he",Great Gatsby
4,414,gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand,Great Gatsby
4,415,dollars.,Great Gatsby
4,416,I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the,Great Gatsby
4,417,"bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June",Great Gatsby
4,418,night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle,Great Gatsby
4,419,of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.,Great Gatsby
4,420,"“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how",Great Gatsby
4,421,I do enjoy it.”,Great Gatsby
4,422,"“What’s the matter, Daisy?”",Great Gatsby
4,423,"I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.",Great Gatsby
4,424,"“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her",Great Gatsby
4,425,on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs,Great Gatsby
4,426,and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s,Great Gatsby
4,427,change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”,Great Gatsby
4,428,She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her,Great Gatsby
4,429,"mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.",Great Gatsby
4,430,She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her,Great Gatsby
4,431,"and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the",Great Gatsby
4,432,soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.,Great Gatsby
4,433,But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and,Great Gatsby
4,434,"put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half",Great Gatsby
4,435,"an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around",Great Gatsby
4,436,her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she,Great Gatsby
4,437,"married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a",Great Gatsby
4,438,three months’ trip to the South Seas.,Great Gatsby
4,439,"I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d",Great Gatsby
4,440,never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a,Great Gatsby
4,441,"minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and",Great Gatsby
4,442,wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the,Great Gatsby
4,443,door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the,Great Gatsby
4,444,"hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with",Great Gatsby
4,445,unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you,Great Gatsby
4,446,"laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I",Great Gatsby
4,447,"left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,",Great Gatsby
4,448,and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got,Great Gatsby
4,449,"into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the",Great Gatsby
4,450,chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.,Great Gatsby
4,451,"The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for",Great Gatsby
4,452,"a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and",Great Gatsby
4,453,then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in,Great Gatsby
4,454,"Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young",Great Gatsby
4,455,"and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect",Great Gatsby
4,456,reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage,Great Gatsby
4,457,"not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,",Great Gatsby
4,458,"moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that",Great Gatsby
4,459,everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy,Great Gatsby
4,460,never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice,Great Gatsby
4,461,of hers …,Great Gatsby
4,462,"Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first",Great Gatsby
4,463,time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew,Great Gatsby
4,464,Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and,Great Gatsby
4,465,"woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was",Great Gatsby
4,466,half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man,Great Gatsby
4,467,she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby,Great Gatsby
4,468,with the officer in her white car.,Great Gatsby
4,469,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
4,470,When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza,Great Gatsby
4,471,for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.,Great Gatsby
4,472,The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in,Great Gatsby
4,473,"the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered",Great Gatsby
4,474,"like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:",Great Gatsby
4,475,“I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when,Great Gatsby
4,476,you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”,Great Gatsby
4,477,"“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.",Great Gatsby
4,478,“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”,Great Gatsby
4,479,“Why not?”,Great Gatsby
4,480,“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”,Great Gatsby
4,481,Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that,Great Gatsby
4,482,"June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of",Great Gatsby
4,483,his purposeless splendour.,Great Gatsby
4,484,"“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your",Great Gatsby
4,485,house some afternoon and then let him come over.”,Great Gatsby
4,486,The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and,Great Gatsby
4,487,bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that,Great Gatsby
4,488,he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.,Great Gatsby
4,489,“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”,Great Gatsby
4,490,"“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be",Great Gatsby
4,491,"offended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”",Great Gatsby
4,492,Something worried me.,Great Gatsby
4,493,“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”,Great Gatsby
4,494,"“He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is",Great Gatsby
4,495,right next door.”,Great Gatsby
4,496,“Oh!”,Great Gatsby
4,497,"“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some",Great Gatsby
4,498,"night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking",Great Gatsby
4,499,"people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It",Great Gatsby
4,500,"was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard",Great Gatsby
4,501,"the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately",Great Gatsby
4,502,suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:,Great Gatsby
4,503,“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘I,Great Gatsby
4,504,want to see her right next door.’,Great Gatsby
4,505,"“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to",Great Gatsby
4,506,"abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he",Great Gatsby
4,507,says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of,Great Gatsby
4,508,catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”,Great Gatsby
4,509,"It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm",Great Gatsby
4,510,around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her,Great Gatsby
4,511,"to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,",Great Gatsby
4,512,"but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal",Great Gatsby
4,513,"scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my",Great Gatsby
4,514,arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady,Great Gatsby
4,515,"excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and",Great Gatsby
4,516,the tired.”,Great Gatsby
4,517,"“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to",Great Gatsby
4,518,me.,Great Gatsby
4,519,“Does she want to see Gatsby?”,Great Gatsby
4,520,“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re,Great Gatsby
4,521,just supposed to invite her to tea.”,Great Gatsby
4,522,"We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth",Great Gatsby
4,523,"Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.",Great Gatsby
4,524,"Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face",Great Gatsby
4,525,"floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up",Great Gatsby
4,526,"the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth",Great Gatsby
4,527,"smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.",Great Gatsby
5,0,When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that,Great Gatsby
5,1,my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the,Great Gatsby
5,2,"peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery",Great Gatsby
5,3,and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a,Great Gatsby
5,4,"corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.",Great Gatsby
5,5,"At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved",Great Gatsby
5,6,itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the,Great Gatsby
5,7,house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in,Great Gatsby
5,8,"the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on",Great Gatsby
5,9,again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned,Great Gatsby
5,10,away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.,Great Gatsby
5,11,"“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.",Great Gatsby
5,12,“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been,Great Gatsby
5,13,"glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old",Great Gatsby
5,14,sport. In my car.”,Great Gatsby
5,15,“It’s too late.”,Great Gatsby
5,16,"“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t made",Great Gatsby
5,17,use of it all summer.”,Great Gatsby
5,18,“I’ve got to go to bed.”,Great Gatsby
5,19,“All right.”,Great Gatsby
5,20,"He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.",Great Gatsby
5,21,"“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call",Great Gatsby
5,22,up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”,Great Gatsby
5,23,"“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you",Great Gatsby
5,24,to any trouble.”,Great Gatsby
5,25,“What day would suit you?”,Great Gatsby
5,26,“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to,Great Gatsby
5,27,"put you to any trouble, you see.”",Great Gatsby
5,28,“How about the day after tomorrow?”,Great Gatsby
5,29,"He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the",Great Gatsby
5,30,"grass cut,” he said.",Great Gatsby
5,31,We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my,Great Gatsby
5,32,"ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I",Great Gatsby
5,33,suspected that he meant my grass.,Great Gatsby
5,34,"“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.",Great Gatsby
5,35,“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.,Great Gatsby
5,36,"“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of",Great Gatsby
5,37,"beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make",Great Gatsby
5,38,"much money, do you?”",Great Gatsby
5,39,“Not very much.”,Great Gatsby
5,40,This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.,Great Gatsby
5,41,"“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a",Great Gatsby
5,42,"little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And",Great Gatsby
5,43,"I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,",Great Gatsby
5,44,"aren’t you, old sport?”",Great Gatsby
5,45,“Trying to.”,Great Gatsby
5,46,"“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time",Great Gatsby
5,47,and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather,Great Gatsby
5,48,confidential sort of thing.”,Great Gatsby
5,49,I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation,Great Gatsby
5,50,"might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer",Great Gatsby
5,51,"was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no",Great Gatsby
5,52,choice except to cut him off there.,Great Gatsby
5,53,"“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t",Great Gatsby
5,54,take on any more work.”,Great Gatsby
5,55,“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he,Great Gatsby
5,56,thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at,Great Gatsby
5,57,"lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,",Great Gatsby
5,58,"hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be",Great Gatsby
5,59,"responsive, so he went unwillingly home.",Great Gatsby
5,60,The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a,Great Gatsby
5,61,deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not,Great Gatsby
5,62,"Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into",Great Gatsby
5,63,rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the,Great Gatsby
5,64,"office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.",Great Gatsby
5,65,"“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.",Great Gatsby
5,66,“What?”,Great Gatsby
5,67,“Don’t bring Tom.”,Great Gatsby
5,68,“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.,Great Gatsby
5,69,The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a,Great Gatsby
5,70,"raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that",Great Gatsby
5,71,Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I,Great Gatsby
5,72,"had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg",Great Gatsby
5,73,Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy,Great Gatsby
5,74,some cups and lemons and flowers.,Great Gatsby
5,75,"The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived",Great Gatsby
5,76,"from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour",Great Gatsby
5,77,"later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel",Great Gatsby
5,78,"suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,",Great Gatsby
5,79,and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.,Great Gatsby
5,80,“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.,Great Gatsby
5,81,"“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”",Great Gatsby
5,82,"“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He",Great Gatsby
5,83,"looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t",Great Gatsby
5,84,believe he saw a thing.,Great Gatsby
5,85,"“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they",Great Gatsby
5,86,thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The,Great Gatsby
5,87,Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”,Great Gatsby
5,88,"I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at",Great Gatsby
5,89,the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the,Great Gatsby
5,90,delicatessen shop.,Great Gatsby
5,91,“Will they do?” I asked.,Great Gatsby
5,92,"“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old",Great Gatsby
5,93,sport.”,Great Gatsby
5,94,"The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which",Great Gatsby
5,95,occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes,Great Gatsby
5,96,"through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that",Great Gatsby
5,97,"shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from",Great Gatsby
5,98,time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were,Great Gatsby
5,99,"taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an",Great Gatsby
5,100,"uncertain voice, that he was going home.",Great Gatsby
5,101,“Why’s that?”,Great Gatsby
5,102,“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if,Great Gatsby
5,103,there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait,Great Gatsby
5,104,all day.”,Great Gatsby
5,105,“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”,Great Gatsby
5,106,"He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously",Great Gatsby
5,107,there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped,Great Gatsby
5,108,"up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.",Great Gatsby
5,109,Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the,Great Gatsby
5,110,"drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a",Great Gatsby
5,111,"three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic",Great Gatsby
5,112,smile.,Great Gatsby
5,113,"“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”",Great Gatsby
5,114,The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I,Great Gatsby
5,115,"had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear",Great Gatsby
5,116,"alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a",Great Gatsby
5,117,"dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with",Great Gatsby
5,118,glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.,Great Gatsby
5,119,"“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have",Great Gatsby
5,120,to come alone?”,Great Gatsby
5,121,“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far,Great Gatsby
5,122,away and spend an hour.”,Great Gatsby
5,123,"“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is",Great Gatsby
5,124,Ferdie.”,Great Gatsby
5,125,“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”,Great Gatsby
5,126,"“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”",Great Gatsby
5,127,We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.,Great Gatsby
5,128,"“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.",Great Gatsby
5,129,“What’s funny?”,Great Gatsby
5,130,She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the,Great Gatsby
5,131,"front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his",Great Gatsby
5,132,"hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a",Great Gatsby
5,133,puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.,Great Gatsby
5,134,With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the,Great Gatsby
5,135,"hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the",Great Gatsby
5,136,living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my,Great Gatsby
5,137,own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.,Great Gatsby
5,138,For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I,Great Gatsby
5,139,"heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by",Great Gatsby
5,140,Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:,Great Gatsby
5,141,“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”,Great Gatsby
5,142,"A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I",Great Gatsby
5,143,went into the room.,Great Gatsby
5,144,"Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the",Great Gatsby
5,145,"mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of",Great Gatsby
5,146,boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face,Great Gatsby
5,147,"of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught",Great Gatsby
5,148,"eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,",Great Gatsby
5,149,on the edge of a stiff chair.,Great Gatsby
5,150,"“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at",Great Gatsby
5,151,"me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily",Great Gatsby
5,152,the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his,Great Gatsby
5,153,"head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and",Great Gatsby
5,154,"set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm",Great Gatsby
5,155,of the sofa and his chin in his hand.,Great Gatsby
5,156,"“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.",Great Gatsby
5,157,My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up,Great Gatsby
5,158,a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.,Great Gatsby
5,159,"“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.",Great Gatsby
5,160,I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on,Great Gatsby
5,161,the floor.,Great Gatsby
5,162,"“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as",Great Gatsby
5,163,matter-of-fact as it could ever be.,Great Gatsby
5,164,“Five years next November.”,Great Gatsby
5,165,The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least,Great Gatsby
5,166,another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate,Great Gatsby
5,167,suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac,Great Gatsby
5,168,Finn brought it in on a tray.,Great Gatsby
5,169,Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical,Great Gatsby
5,170,"decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,",Great Gatsby
5,171,"while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other",Great Gatsby
5,172,"of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in",Great Gatsby
5,173,"itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my",Great Gatsby
5,174,feet.,Great Gatsby
5,175,“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.,Great Gatsby
5,176,“I’ll be back.”,Great Gatsby
5,177,“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”,Great Gatsby
5,178,"He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and",Great Gatsby
5,179,"whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.",Great Gatsby
5,180,“What’s the matter?”,Great Gatsby
5,181,"“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to",Great Gatsby
5,182,"side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”",Great Gatsby
5,183,"“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s",Great Gatsby
5,184,embarrassed too.”,Great Gatsby
5,185,“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.,Great Gatsby
5,186,“Just as much as you are.”,Great Gatsby
5,187,“Don’t talk so loud.”,Great Gatsby
5,188,"“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only",Great Gatsby
5,189,"that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”",Great Gatsby
5,190,"He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable",Great Gatsby
5,191,"reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other",Great Gatsby
5,192,room.,Great Gatsby
5,193,I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his,Great Gatsby
5,194,nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge,Great Gatsby
5,195,"black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the",Great Gatsby
5,196,"rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by",Great Gatsby
5,197,"Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric",Great Gatsby
5,198,marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except,Great Gatsby
5,199,"Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church",Great Gatsby
5,200,"steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period”",Great Gatsby
5,201,"craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay",Great Gatsby
5,202,five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would,Great Gatsby
5,203,have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the,Great Gatsby
5,204,heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate,Great Gatsby
5,205,decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on,Great Gatsby
5,206,"the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have",Great Gatsby
5,207,always been obstinate about being peasantry.,Great Gatsby
5,208,"After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile",Great Gatsby
5,209,rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’,Great Gatsby
5,210,dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening,Great Gatsby
5,211,"the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,",Great Gatsby
5,212,"leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the",Great Gatsby
5,213,garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had,Great Gatsby
5,214,"seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little",Great Gatsby
5,215,now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that,Great Gatsby
5,216,silence had fallen within the house too.,Great Gatsby
5,217,"I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of",Great Gatsby
5,218,pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They,Great Gatsby
5,219,"were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if",Great Gatsby
5,220,"some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of",Great Gatsby
5,221,"embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when",Great Gatsby
5,222,I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief,Great Gatsby
5,223,before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply,Great Gatsby
5,224,confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of,Great Gatsby
5,225,exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little,Great Gatsby
5,226,room.,Great Gatsby
5,227,"“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I",Great Gatsby
5,228,thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.,Great Gatsby
5,229,“It’s stopped raining.”,Great Gatsby
5,230,"“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were",Great Gatsby
5,231,"twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,",Great Gatsby
5,232,"like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to",Great Gatsby
5,233,Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”,Great Gatsby
5,234,"“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told",Great Gatsby
5,235,only of her unexpected joy.,Great Gatsby
5,236,"“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to",Great Gatsby
5,237,show her around.”,Great Gatsby
5,238,“You’re sure you want me to come?”,Great Gatsby
5,239,"“Absolutely, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
5,240,Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with,Great Gatsby
5,241,humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.,Great Gatsby
5,242,"“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole",Great Gatsby
5,243,front of it catches the light.”,Great Gatsby
5,244,I agreed that it was splendid.,Great Gatsby
5,245,"“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It",Great Gatsby
5,246,took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”,Great Gatsby
5,247,“I thought you inherited your money.”,Great Gatsby
5,248,"“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in",Great Gatsby
5,249,the big panic—the panic of the war.”,Great Gatsby
5,250,"I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what",Great Gatsby
5,251,"business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized",Great Gatsby
5,252,that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.,Great Gatsby
5,253,"“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the",Great Gatsby
5,254,drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in,Great Gatsby
5,255,either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean,Great Gatsby
5,256,you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”,Great Gatsby
5,257,"Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of",Great Gatsby
5,258,brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.,Great Gatsby
5,259,“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.,Great Gatsby
5,260,“Do you like it?”,Great Gatsby
5,261,"“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”",Great Gatsby
5,262,"“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People",Great Gatsby
5,263,who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”,Great Gatsby
5,264,Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the,Great Gatsby
5,265,road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy,Great Gatsby
5,266,"admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,",Great Gatsby
5,267,"admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy",Great Gatsby
5,268,odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of,Great Gatsby
5,269,kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find,Great Gatsby
5,270,"no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but",Great Gatsby
5,271,bird voices in the trees.,Great Gatsby
5,272,"And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and",Great Gatsby
5,273,"Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind",Great Gatsby
5,274,"every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we",Great Gatsby
5,275,had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College,Great Gatsby
5,276,Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into,Great Gatsby
5,277,ghostly laughter.,Great Gatsby
5,278,"We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender",Great Gatsby
5,279,"silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,",Great Gatsby
5,280,and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a,Great Gatsby
5,281,dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It,Great Gatsby
5,282,"was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily",Great Gatsby
5,283,about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own,Great Gatsby
5,284,"apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat",Great Gatsby
5,285,down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in,Great Gatsby
5,286,the wall.,Great Gatsby
5,287,"He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued",Great Gatsby
5,288,everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew,Great Gatsby
5,289,"from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his",Great Gatsby
5,290,"possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding",Great Gatsby
5,291,presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a,Great Gatsby
5,292,flight of stairs.,Great Gatsby
5,293,His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was,Great Gatsby
5,294,garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush,Great Gatsby
5,295,"with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and",Great Gatsby
5,296,shaded his eyes and began to laugh.,Great Gatsby
5,297,"“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I",Great Gatsby
5,298,can’t—When I try to—”,Great Gatsby
5,299,He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a,Great Gatsby
5,300,third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed,Great Gatsby
5,301,"with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,",Great Gatsby
5,302,"dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to",Great Gatsby
5,303,"speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,",Great Gatsby
5,304,he was running down like an over-wound clock.,Great Gatsby
5,305,Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent,Great Gatsby
5,306,"cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and",Great Gatsby
5,307,"his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.",Great Gatsby
5,308,“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a,Great Gatsby
5,309,"selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”",Great Gatsby
5,310,"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,",Great Gatsby
5,311,"before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,",Great Gatsby
5,312,which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in,Great Gatsby
5,313,many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft,Great Gatsby
5,314,rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in,Great Gatsby
5,315,"coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of",Great Gatsby
5,316,"indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into",Great Gatsby
5,317,the shirts and began to cry stormily.,Great Gatsby
5,318,"“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the",Great Gatsby
5,319,thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such,Great Gatsby
5,320,beautiful shirts before.”,Great Gatsby
5,321,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
5,322,"After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and",Great Gatsby
5,323,"the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window",Great Gatsby
5,324,"it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated",Great Gatsby
5,325,surface of the Sound.,Great Gatsby
5,326,"“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”",Great Gatsby
5,327,said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at,Great Gatsby
5,328,the end of your dock.”,Great Gatsby
5,329,"Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what",Great Gatsby
5,330,he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal,Great Gatsby
5,331,significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the,Great Gatsby
5,332,great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very,Great Gatsby
5,333,"near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to",Great Gatsby
5,334,the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of,Great Gatsby
5,335,enchanted objects had diminished by one.,Great Gatsby
5,336,"I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects",Great Gatsby
5,337,in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting,Great Gatsby
5,338,"costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.",Great Gatsby
5,339,“Who’s this?”,Great Gatsby
5,340,"“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
5,341,The name sounded faintly familiar.,Great Gatsby
5,342,“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”,Great Gatsby
5,343,"There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the",Great Gatsby
5,344,bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently,Great Gatsby
5,345,when he was about eighteen.,Great Gatsby
5,346,"“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you",Great Gatsby
5,347,had a pompadour—or a yacht.”,Great Gatsby
5,348,"“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—about",Great Gatsby
5,349,you.”,Great Gatsby
5,350,They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the,Great Gatsby
5,351,"rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.",Great Gatsby
5,352,"“Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said a",Great Gatsby
5,353,"small town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use to",Great Gatsby
5,354,us if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”,Great Gatsby
5,355,He rang off.,Great Gatsby
5,356,“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.,Great Gatsby
5,357,"The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,",Great Gatsby
5,358,and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.,Great Gatsby
5,359,"“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to",Great Gatsby
5,360,just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you,Great Gatsby
5,361,around.”,Great Gatsby
5,362,"I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence",Great Gatsby
5,363,made them feel more satisfactorily alone.,Great Gatsby
5,364,"“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the",Great Gatsby
5,365,piano.”,Great Gatsby
5,366,He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes,Great Gatsby
5,367,"accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with",Great Gatsby
5,368,shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently,Great Gatsby
5,369,"clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck",Great Gatsby
5,370,trousers of a nebulous hue.,Great Gatsby
5,371,“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.,Great Gatsby
5,372,"“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.",Great Gatsby
5,373,"“That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up …”",Great Gatsby
5,374,"“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t",Great Gatsby
5,375,"you, Ewing, old sport?”",Great Gatsby
5,376,“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”,Great Gatsby
5,377,"“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The",Great Gatsby
5,378,grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.,Great Gatsby
5,379,In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.,Great Gatsby
5,380,"He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her",Great Gatsby
5,381,"on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the",Great Gatsby
5,382,gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.,Great Gatsby
5,383,When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the,Great Gatsby
5,384,bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.,Great Gatsby
5,385,"“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all",Great Gatsby
5,386,out of prac—”,Great Gatsby
5,387,"“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”",Great Gatsby
5,388,"“In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”",Great Gatsby
5,389,Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along,Great Gatsby
5,390,the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric,Great Gatsby
5,391,"trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New",Great Gatsby
5,392,"York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was",Great Gatsby
5,393,generating on the air.,Great Gatsby
5,394,“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the,Great Gatsby
5,395,"poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”",Great Gatsby
5,396,As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of,Great Gatsby
5,397,"bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt",Great Gatsby
5,398,had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost,Great Gatsby
5,399,five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when,Great Gatsby
5,400,"Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but",Great Gatsby
5,401,because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond,Great Gatsby
5,402,"her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative",Great Gatsby
5,403,"passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright",Great Gatsby
5,404,feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can,Great Gatsby
5,405,challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.,Great Gatsby
5,406,"As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took",Great Gatsby
5,407,"hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned",Great Gatsby
5,408,"toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,",Great Gatsby
5,409,"with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be",Great Gatsby
5,410,over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.,Great Gatsby
5,411,"They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;",Great Gatsby
5,412,Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they,Great Gatsby
5,413,"looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went",Great Gatsby
5,414,"out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them",Great Gatsby
5,415,there together.,Great Gatsby
6,0,About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one,Great Gatsby
6,1,morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.,Great Gatsby
6,2,“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.,Great Gatsby
6,3,“Why—any statement to give out.”,Great Gatsby
6,4,It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard,Great Gatsby
6,5,Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either,Great Gatsby
6,6,wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and,Great Gatsby
6,7,with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”,Great Gatsby
6,8,"It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.",Great Gatsby
6,9,"Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his",Great Gatsby
6,10,"hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all",Great Gatsby
6,11,summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends,Great Gatsby
6,12,such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to,Great Gatsby
6,13,"him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house",Great Gatsby
6,14,"at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly",Great Gatsby
6,15,up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a,Great Gatsby
6,16,"source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to",Great Gatsby
6,17,say.,Great Gatsby
6,18,"James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had",Great Gatsby
6,19,changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that,Great Gatsby
6,20,witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht,Great Gatsby
6,21,drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was,Great Gatsby
6,22,James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a,Great Gatsby
6,23,"torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay",Great Gatsby
6,24,"Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and",Great Gatsby
6,25,informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an,Great Gatsby
6,26,hour.,Great Gatsby
6,27,"I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His",Great Gatsby
6,28,parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination,Great Gatsby
6,29,had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was,Great Gatsby
6,30,"that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic",Great Gatsby
6,31,"conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means",Great Gatsby
6,32,"anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,",Great Gatsby
6,33,"the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented",Great Gatsby
6,34,just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be,Great Gatsby
6,35,"likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.",Great Gatsby
6,36,For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of,Great Gatsby
6,37,Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other,Great Gatsby
6,38,"capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body",Great Gatsby
6,39,"lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing",Great Gatsby
6,40,"days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became",Great Gatsby
6,41,"contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of",Great Gatsby
6,42,the others because they were hysterical about things which in his,Great Gatsby
6,43,overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.,Great Gatsby
6,44,"But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque",Great Gatsby
6,45,and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of,Great Gatsby
6,46,ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock,Great Gatsby
6,47,ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled,Great Gatsby
6,48,clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his,Great Gatsby
6,49,fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an,Great Gatsby
6,50,oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for,Great Gatsby
6,51,his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of,Great Gatsby
6,52,"reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on",Great Gatsby
6,53,a fairy’s wing.,Great Gatsby
6,54,"An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,",Great Gatsby
6,55,to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He,Great Gatsby
6,56,"stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the",Great Gatsby
6,57,"drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s",Great Gatsby
6,58,work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to,Great Gatsby
6,59,"Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the",Great Gatsby
6,60,day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.,Great Gatsby
6,61,"Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,",Great Gatsby
6,62,"of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The",Great Gatsby
6,63,transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire,Great Gatsby
6,64,"found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,",Great Gatsby
6,65,"suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him",Great Gatsby
6,66,"from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,",Great Gatsby
6,67,"the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and",Great Gatsby
6,68,"sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid",Great Gatsby
6,69,journalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable,Great Gatsby
6,70,shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in,Great Gatsby
6,71,Little Girl Bay.,Great Gatsby
6,72,"To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,",Great Gatsby
6,73,that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I,Great Gatsby
6,74,suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked,Great Gatsby
6,75,him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of,Great Gatsby
6,76,them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and,Great Gatsby
6,77,extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and,Great Gatsby
6,78,"bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a",Great Gatsby
6,79,yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the,Great Gatsby
6,80,"Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.",Great Gatsby
6,81,He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with,Great Gatsby
6,82,"Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even",Great Gatsby
6,83,"jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk",Great Gatsby
6,84,"might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by",Great Gatsby
6,85,reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five,Great Gatsby
6,86,"years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.",Great Gatsby
6,87,It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye,Great Gatsby
6,88,came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody,Great Gatsby
6,89,inhospitably died.,Great Gatsby
6,90,"I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid",Great Gatsby
6,91,"man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one",Great Gatsby
6,92,phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage,Great Gatsby
6,93,violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to,Great Gatsby
6,94,Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay,Great Gatsby
6,95,parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he,Great Gatsby
6,96,formed the habit of letting liquor alone.,Great Gatsby
6,97,And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five,Great Gatsby
6,98,thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal,Great Gatsby
6,99,"device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions",Great Gatsby
6,100,went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate,Great Gatsby
6,101,education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the,Great Gatsby
6,102,substantiality of a man.,Great Gatsby
6,103,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
6,104,"He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with",Great Gatsby
6,105,"the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,",Great Gatsby
6,106,which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time,Great Gatsby
6,107,"of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and",Great Gatsby
6,108,"nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while",Great Gatsby
6,109,"Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of",Great Gatsby
6,110,misconceptions away.,Great Gatsby
6,111,"It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several",Great Gatsby
6,112,weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in,Great Gatsby
6,113,"New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself",Great Gatsby
6,114,with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday,Great Gatsby
6,115,afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom,Great Gatsby
6,116,"Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really",Great Gatsby
6,117,surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.,Great Gatsby
6,118,They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and,Great Gatsby
6,119,"a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.",Great Gatsby
6,120,"“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m",Great Gatsby
6,121,delighted that you dropped in.”,Great Gatsby
6,122,As though they cared!,Great Gatsby
6,123,“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the,Great Gatsby
6,124,"room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in",Great Gatsby
6,125,just a minute.”,Great Gatsby
6,126,He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he,Great Gatsby
6,127,"would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in",Great Gatsby
6,128,a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted,Great Gatsby
6,129,"nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,",Great Gatsby
6,130,thanks … I’m sorry—,Great Gatsby
6,131,“Did you have a nice ride?”,Great Gatsby
6,132,“Very good roads around here.”,Great Gatsby
6,133,“I suppose the automobiles—”,Great Gatsby
6,134,“Yeah.”,Great Gatsby
6,135,"Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had",Great Gatsby
6,136,accepted the introduction as a stranger.,Great Gatsby
6,137,"“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”",Great Gatsby
6,138,"“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.",Great Gatsby
6,139,“So we did. I remember very well.”,Great Gatsby
6,140,“About two weeks ago.”,Great Gatsby
6,141,“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”,Great Gatsby
6,142,"“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.",Great Gatsby
6,143,“That so?”,Great Gatsby
6,144,Tom turned to me.,Great Gatsby
6,145,"“You live near here, Nick?”",Great Gatsby
6,146,“Next door.”,Great Gatsby
6,147,“That so?”,Great Gatsby
6,148,"Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back",Great Gatsby
6,149,haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until,Great Gatsby
6,150,"unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.",Great Gatsby
6,151,"“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.",Great Gatsby
6,152,“What do you say?”,Great Gatsby
6,153,“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”,Great Gatsby
6,154,"“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought",Great Gatsby
6,155,to be starting home.”,Great Gatsby
6,156,"“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself",Great Gatsby
6,157,"now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you",Great Gatsby
6,158,stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped,Great Gatsby
6,159,in from New York.”,Great Gatsby
6,160,"“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of",Great Gatsby
6,161,you.”,Great Gatsby
6,162,This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.,Great Gatsby
6,163,"“Come along,” he said—but to her only.",Great Gatsby
6,164,"“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”",Great Gatsby
6,165,Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see,Great Gatsby
6,166,that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.,Great Gatsby
6,167,"“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.",Great Gatsby
6,168,"“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.",Great Gatsby
6,169,Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.,Great Gatsby
6,170,"“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.",Great Gatsby
6,171,"“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but",Great Gatsby
6,172,I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse,Great Gatsby
6,173,me for just a minute.”,Great Gatsby
6,174,"The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady",Great Gatsby
6,175,began an impassioned conversation aside.,Great Gatsby
6,176,"“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she",Great Gatsby
6,177,doesn’t want him?”,Great Gatsby
6,178,“She says she does want him.”,Great Gatsby
6,179,“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He,Great Gatsby
6,180,"frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be",Great Gatsby
6,181,"old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to",Great Gatsby
6,182,suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”,Great Gatsby
6,183,Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted,Great Gatsby
6,184,their horses.,Great Gatsby
6,185,"“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.”  And",Great Gatsby
6,186,"then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”",Great Gatsby
6,187,"Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they",Great Gatsby
6,188,"trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage",Great Gatsby
6,189,"just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the",Great Gatsby
6,190,front door.,Great Gatsby
6,191,"Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on",Great Gatsby
6,192,the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s,Great Gatsby
6,193,party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of,Great Gatsby
6,194,oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties,Great Gatsby
6,195,"that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of",Great Gatsby
6,196,"people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,",Great Gatsby
6,197,"many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a",Great Gatsby
6,198,pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had,Great Gatsby
6,199,"merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete",Great Gatsby
6,200,"in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to",Great Gatsby
6,201,"nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was",Great Gatsby
6,202,"looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening",Great Gatsby
6,203,to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your,Great Gatsby
6,204,own powers of adjustment.,Great Gatsby
6,205,"They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling",Great Gatsby
6,206,"hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.",Great Gatsby
6,207,"“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me",Great Gatsby
6,208,"any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad",Great Gatsby
6,209,to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.,Great Gatsby
6,210,I’m giving out green—”,Great Gatsby
6,211,"“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.",Great Gatsby
6,212,“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”,Great Gatsby
6,213,“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”,Great Gatsby
6,214,Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.,Great Gatsby
6,215,"“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking",Great Gatsby
6,216,I don’t know a soul here.”,Great Gatsby
6,217,"“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely",Great Gatsby
6,218,human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom,Great Gatsby
6,219,"and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies",Great Gatsby
6,220,the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.,Great Gatsby
6,221,"“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.",Great Gatsby
6,222,“The man bending over her is her director.”,Great Gatsby
6,223,He took them ceremoniously from group to group:,Great Gatsby
6,224,“Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he,Great Gatsby
6,225,added: “the polo player.”,Great Gatsby
6,226,"“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”",Great Gatsby
6,227,But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the,Great Gatsby
6,228,polo player” for the rest of the evening.,Great Gatsby
6,229,"“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that",Great Gatsby
6,230,man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”,Great Gatsby
6,231,"Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.",Great Gatsby
6,232,"“Well, I liked him anyhow.”",Great Gatsby
6,233,"“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,",Great Gatsby
6,234,“I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”,Great Gatsby
6,235,"Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,",Great Gatsby
6,236,conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they,Great Gatsby
6,237,"sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,",Great Gatsby
6,238,while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case,Great Gatsby
6,239,"there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”",Great Gatsby
6,240,Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper,Great Gatsby
6,241,together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he,Great Gatsby
6,242,said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”,Great Gatsby
6,243,"“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any",Great Gatsby
6,244,addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after a,Great Gatsby
6,245,"moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that",Great Gatsby
6,246,except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t,Great Gatsby
6,247,having a good time.,Great Gatsby
6,248,We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had,Great Gatsby
6,249,"been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two",Great Gatsby
6,250,weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air,Great Gatsby
6,251,now.,Great Gatsby
6,252,"“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”",Great Gatsby
6,253,"The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my",Great Gatsby
6,254,shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.,Great Gatsby
6,255,“Wha’?”,Great Gatsby
6,256,"A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf",Great Gatsby
6,257,"with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:",Great Gatsby
6,258,"“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she",Great Gatsby
6,259,always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it,Great Gatsby
6,260,alone.”,Great Gatsby
6,261,"“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.",Great Gatsby
6,262,"“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody",Great Gatsby
6,263,"that needs your help, Doc.’ ”",Great Gatsby
6,264,"“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without",Great Gatsby
6,265,"gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in",Great Gatsby
6,266,the pool.”,Great Gatsby
6,267,"“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss",Great Gatsby
6,268,Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”,Great Gatsby
6,269,"“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.",Great Gatsby
6,270,“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand,Great Gatsby
6,271,shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”,Great Gatsby
6,272,It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with,Great Gatsby
6,273,Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were,Great Gatsby
6,274,still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except,Great Gatsby
6,275,"for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he",Great Gatsby
6,276,had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this,Great Gatsby
6,277,"proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate",Great Gatsby
6,278,degree and kiss at her cheek.,Great Gatsby
6,279,"“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”",Great Gatsby
6,280,But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture,Great Gatsby
6,281,"but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented",Great Gatsby
6,282,“place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing,Great Gatsby
6,283,village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old,Great Gatsby
6,284,euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants,Great Gatsby
6,285,along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in,Great Gatsby
6,286,the very simplicity she failed to understand.,Great Gatsby
6,287,I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.,Great Gatsby
6,288,It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet,Great Gatsby
6,289,of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow,Great Gatsby
6,290,"moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,",Great Gatsby
6,291,"an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an",Great Gatsby
6,292,invisible glass.,Great Gatsby
6,293,“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big,Great Gatsby
6,294,bootlegger?”,Great Gatsby
6,295,“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.,Great Gatsby
6,296,“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are,Great Gatsby
6,297,"just big bootleggers, you know.”",Great Gatsby
6,298,"“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.",Great Gatsby
6,299,He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under,Great Gatsby
6,300,his feet.,Great Gatsby
6,301,"“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie",Great Gatsby
6,302,together.”,Great Gatsby
6,303,A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.,Great Gatsby
6,304,"“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said",Great Gatsby
6,305,with an effort.,Great Gatsby
6,306,“You didn’t look so interested.”,Great Gatsby
6,307,"“Well, I was.”",Great Gatsby
6,308,Tom laughed and turned to me.,Great Gatsby
6,309,“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under,Great Gatsby
6,310,a cold shower?”,Great Gatsby
6,311,"Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,",Great Gatsby
6,312,bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and,Great Gatsby
6,313,would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up,Great Gatsby
6,314,"sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change",Great Gatsby
6,315,tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.,Great Gatsby
6,316,"“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said",Great Gatsby
6,317,suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way,Great Gatsby
6,318,in and he’s too polite to object.”,Great Gatsby
6,319,"“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I",Great Gatsby
6,320,think I’ll make a point of finding out.”,Great Gatsby
6,321,"“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a",Great Gatsby
6,322,lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”,Great Gatsby
6,323,The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.,Great Gatsby
6,324,"“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.",Great Gatsby
6,325,"Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where",Great Gatsby
6,326,"“Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,",Great Gatsby
6,327,"was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of",Great Gatsby
6,328,Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from,Great Gatsby
6,329,her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling,Great Gatsby
6,330,"her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?",Great Gatsby
6,331,"Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare",Great Gatsby
6,332,"and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with",Great Gatsby
6,333,"one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would",Great Gatsby
6,334,blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.,Great Gatsby
6,335,"I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,",Great Gatsby
6,336,and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had,Great Gatsby
6,337,"run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights",Great Gatsby
6,338,were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the,Great Gatsby
6,339,"steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,",Great Gatsby
6,340,and his eyes were bright and tired.,Great Gatsby
6,341,"“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.",Great Gatsby
6,342,“Of course she did.”,Great Gatsby
6,343,"“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”",Great Gatsby
6,344,"He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.",Great Gatsby
6,345,"“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her",Great Gatsby
6,346,understand.”,Great Gatsby
6,347,“You mean about the dance?”,Great Gatsby
6,348,“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of,Great Gatsby
6,349,"his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”",Great Gatsby
6,350,He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and,Great Gatsby
6,351,say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with,Great Gatsby
6,352,that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be,Great Gatsby
6,353,"taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back",Great Gatsby
6,354,to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five,Great Gatsby
6,355,years ago.,Great Gatsby
6,356,"“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to",Great Gatsby
6,357,understand. We’d sit for hours—”,Great Gatsby
6,358,He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit,Great Gatsby
6,359,rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.,Great Gatsby
6,360,"“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the",Great Gatsby
6,361,past.”,Great Gatsby
6,362,“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you,Great Gatsby
6,363,can!”,Great Gatsby
6,364,"He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the",Great Gatsby
6,365,"shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.",Great Gatsby
6,366,"“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,",Great Gatsby
6,367,nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”,Great Gatsby
6,368,"He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to",Great Gatsby
6,369,"recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into",Great Gatsby
6,370,"loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,",Great Gatsby
6,371,but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it,Great Gatsby
6,372,"all slowly, he could find out what that thing was …",Great Gatsby
6,373,"… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the",Great Gatsby
6,374,"street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where",Great Gatsby
6,375,there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They,Great Gatsby
6,376,stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night,Great Gatsby
6,377,with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes,Great Gatsby
6,378,of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the,Great Gatsby
6,379,darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the,Great Gatsby
6,380,corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really,Great Gatsby
6,381,formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could,Great Gatsby
6,382,"climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the",Great Gatsby
6,383,"pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.",Great Gatsby
6,384,His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He,Great Gatsby
6,385,"knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable",Great Gatsby
6,386,"visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like",Great Gatsby
6,387,"the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the",Great Gatsby
6,388,tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At,Great Gatsby
6,389,his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the,Great Gatsby
6,390,incarnation was complete.,Great Gatsby
6,391,"Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was",Great Gatsby
6,392,"reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,",Great Gatsby
6,393,that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase,Great Gatsby
6,394,"tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,",Great Gatsby
6,395,as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled,Great Gatsby
6,396,"air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was",Great Gatsby
6,397,uncommunicable forever.,Great Gatsby
7,0,It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights,Great Gatsby
7,1,"in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as",Great Gatsby
7,2,"it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I",Great Gatsby
7,3,become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his,Great Gatsby
7,4,drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering,Great Gatsby
7,5,if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a,Great Gatsby
7,6,villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.,Great Gatsby
7,7,“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”,Great Gatsby
7,8,"“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.",Great Gatsby
7,9,"“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.",Great Gatsby
7,10,Carraway came over.”,Great Gatsby
7,11,“Who?” he demanded rudely.,Great Gatsby
7,12,“Carraway.”,Great Gatsby
7,13,"“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”",Great Gatsby
7,14,Abruptly he slammed the door.,Great Gatsby
7,15,My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his,Great Gatsby
7,16,"house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never",Great Gatsby
7,17,"went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered",Great Gatsby
7,18,moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that,Great Gatsby
7,19,"the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the",Great Gatsby
7,20,village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.,Great Gatsby
7,21,Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.,Great Gatsby
7,22,“Going away?” I inquired.,Great Gatsby
7,23,"“No, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
7,24,“I hear you fired all your servants.”,Great Gatsby
7,25,“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite,Great Gatsby
7,26,often—in the afternoons.”,Great Gatsby
7,27,So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the,Great Gatsby
7,28,disapproval in her eyes.,Great Gatsby
7,29,“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all,Great Gatsby
7,30,brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”,Great Gatsby
7,31,“I see.”,Great Gatsby
7,32,He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her,Great Gatsby
7,33,house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy,Great Gatsby
7,34,herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was,Great Gatsby
7,35,coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would,Great Gatsby
7,36,choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing,Great Gatsby
7,37,scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.,Great Gatsby
7,38,"The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of",Great Gatsby
7,39,"the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only",Great Gatsby
7,40,the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering,Great Gatsby
7,41,hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of,Great Gatsby
7,42,combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into,Great Gatsby
7,43,"her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her",Great Gatsby
7,44,"fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her",Great Gatsby
7,45,pocketbook slapped to the floor.,Great Gatsby
7,46,"“Oh, my!” she gasped.",Great Gatsby
7,47,"I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it",Great Gatsby
7,48,at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that,Great Gatsby
7,49,"I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,",Great Gatsby
7,50,suspected me just the same.,Great Gatsby
7,51,“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! …,Great Gatsby
7,52,Hot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?”,Great Gatsby
7,53,My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.,Great Gatsby
7,54,"That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,",Great Gatsby
7,55,whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!,Great Gatsby
7,56,"… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying",Great Gatsby
7,57,the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at,Great Gatsby
7,58,the door.,Great Gatsby
7,59,“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m,Great Gatsby
7,60,"sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this",Great Gatsby
7,61,noon!”,Great Gatsby
7,62,What he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”,Great Gatsby
7,63,"He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to",Great Gatsby
7,64,take our stiff straw hats.,Great Gatsby
7,65,"“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the",Great Gatsby
7,66,direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the,Great Gatsby
7,67,common store of life.,Great Gatsby
7,68,"The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and",Great Gatsby
7,69,"Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down",Great Gatsby
7,70,their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.,Great Gatsby
7,71,"“We can’t move,” they said together.",Great Gatsby
7,72,"Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment",Great Gatsby
7,73,in mine.,Great Gatsby
7,74,"“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.",Great Gatsby
7,75,"Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall",Great Gatsby
7,76,telephone.,Great Gatsby
7,77,Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with,Great Gatsby
7,78,"fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting",Great Gatsby
7,79,laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.,Great Gatsby
7,80,"“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the",Great Gatsby
7,81,telephone.”,Great Gatsby
7,82,We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very,Great Gatsby
7,83,"well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations",Great Gatsby
7,84,"to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I",Great Gatsby
7,85,won’t stand that at all!”,Great Gatsby
7,86,"“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.",Great Gatsby
7,87,"“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to",Great Gatsby
7,88,know about it.”,Great Gatsby
7,89,"Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his",Great Gatsby
7,90,"thick body, and hurried into the room.",Great Gatsby
7,91,"“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed",Great Gatsby
7,92,"dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”",Great Gatsby
7,93,"“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.",Great Gatsby
7,94,As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and,Great Gatsby
7,95,"pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.",Great Gatsby
7,96,"“You know I love you,” she murmured.",Great Gatsby
7,97,"“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.",Great Gatsby
7,98,Daisy looked around doubtfully.,Great Gatsby
7,99,“You kiss Nick too.”,Great Gatsby
7,100,"“What a low, vulgar girl!”",Great Gatsby
7,101,"“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.",Great Gatsby
7,102,Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just,Great Gatsby
7,103,as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.,Great Gatsby
7,104,"“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your",Great Gatsby
7,105,own mother that loves you.”,Great Gatsby
7,106,"The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and",Great Gatsby
7,107,rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.,Great Gatsby
7,108,“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy,Great Gatsby
7,109,"hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”",Great Gatsby
7,110,Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.,Great Gatsby
7,111,Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he,Great Gatsby
7,112,had ever really believed in its existence before.,Great Gatsby
7,113,"“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to",Great Gatsby
7,114,Daisy.,Great Gatsby
7,115,“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent,Great Gatsby
7,116,"into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You",Great Gatsby
7,117,absolute little dream.”,Great Gatsby
7,118,"“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress",Great Gatsby
7,119,too.”,Great Gatsby
7,120,“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that,Great Gatsby
7,121,she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”,Great Gatsby
7,122,“Where’s Daddy?”,Great Gatsby
7,123,"“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks like",Great Gatsby
7,124,me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”,Great Gatsby
7,125,Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held,Great Gatsby
7,126,out her hand.,Great Gatsby
7,127,"“Come, Pammy.”",Great Gatsby
7,128,"“Goodbye, sweetheart!”",Great Gatsby
7,129,With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to,Great Gatsby
7,130,"her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,",Great Gatsby
7,131,preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.,Great Gatsby
7,132,Gatsby took up his drink.,Great Gatsby
7,133,"“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.",Great Gatsby
7,134,"We drank in long, greedy swallows.",Great Gatsby
7,135,"“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom",Great Gatsby
7,136,genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into,Great Gatsby
7,137,the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting,Great Gatsby
7,138,colder every year.,Great Gatsby
7,139,"“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look",Great Gatsby
7,140,at the place.”,Great Gatsby
7,141,"I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in",Great Gatsby
7,142,"the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.",Great Gatsby
7,143,Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed,Great Gatsby
7,144,across the bay.,Great Gatsby
7,145,“I’m right across from you.”,Great Gatsby
7,146,“So you are.”,Great Gatsby
7,147,Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy,Great Gatsby
7,148,refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat,Great Gatsby
7,149,moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped,Great Gatsby
7,150,ocean and the abounding blessed isles.,Great Gatsby
7,151,"“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there",Great Gatsby
7,152,with him for about an hour.”,Great Gatsby
7,153,"We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and",Great Gatsby
7,154,drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.,Great Gatsby
7,155,"“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the",Great Gatsby
7,156,"day after that, and the next thirty years?”",Great Gatsby
7,157,"“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it",Great Gatsby
7,158,gets crisp in the fall.”,Great Gatsby
7,159,"“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and",Great Gatsby
7,160,everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”,Great Gatsby
7,161,"Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding",Great Gatsby
7,162,its senselessness into forms.,Great Gatsby
7,163,"“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to",Great Gatsby
7,164,"Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a",Great Gatsby
7,165,garage.”,Great Gatsby
7,166,“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes,Great Gatsby
7,167,"floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”",Great Gatsby
7,168,"Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in",Great Gatsby
7,169,space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.,Great Gatsby
7,170,"“You always look so cool,” she repeated.",Great Gatsby
7,171,"She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was",Great Gatsby
7,172,"astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and",Great Gatsby
7,173,then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew,Great Gatsby
7,174,a long time ago.,Great Gatsby
7,175,"“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.",Great Gatsby
7,176,“You know the advertisement of the man—”,Great Gatsby
7,177,"“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to",Great Gatsby
7,178,town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”,Great Gatsby
7,179,"He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one",Great Gatsby
7,180,moved.,Great Gatsby
7,181,"“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow?",Great Gatsby
7,182,"If we’re going to town, let’s start.”",Great Gatsby
7,183,"His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips",Great Gatsby
7,184,the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out,Great Gatsby
7,185,on to the blazing gravel drive.,Great Gatsby
7,186,“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going,Great Gatsby
7,187,to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”,Great Gatsby
7,188,“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”,Great Gatsby
7,189,"“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”",Great Gatsby
7,190,He didn’t answer.,Great Gatsby
7,191,"“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”",Great Gatsby
7,192,They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there,Great Gatsby
7,193,shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon,Great Gatsby
7,194,"hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed",Great Gatsby
7,195,"his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.",Great Gatsby
7,196,“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.,Great Gatsby
7,197,“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”,Great Gatsby
7,198,“Oh.”,Great Gatsby
7,199,A pause.,Great Gatsby
7,200,"“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.",Great Gatsby
7,201,“Women get these notions in their heads—”,Great Gatsby
7,202,“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.,Great Gatsby
7,203,"“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.",Great Gatsby
7,204,Gatsby turned to me rigidly:,Great Gatsby
7,205,"“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
7,206,"“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I",Great Gatsby
7,207,hesitated.,Great Gatsby
7,208,"“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.",Great Gatsby
7,209,That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that,Great Gatsby
7,210,"was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of",Great Gatsby
7,211,"it, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s",Great Gatsby
7,212,"daughter, the golden girl …",Great Gatsby
7,213,"Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed",Great Gatsby
7,214,by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and,Great Gatsby
7,215,carrying light capes over their arms.,Great Gatsby
7,216,"“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green",Great Gatsby
7,217,leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”,Great Gatsby
7,218,“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.,Great Gatsby
7,219,“Yes.”,Great Gatsby
7,220,"“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",Great Gatsby
7,221,The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.,Great Gatsby
7,222,"“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.",Great Gatsby
7,223,"“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And",Great Gatsby
7,224,if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a,Great Gatsby
7,225,drugstore nowadays.”,Great Gatsby
7,226,A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom,Great Gatsby
7,227,"frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar",Great Gatsby
7,228,"and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in",Great Gatsby
7,229,"words, passed over Gatsby’s face.",Great Gatsby
7,230,"“Come on, Daisy” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s",Great Gatsby
7,231,car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”,Great Gatsby
7,232,"He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.",Great Gatsby
7,233,“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”,Great Gatsby
7,234,"She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan",Great Gatsby
7,235,"and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the",Great Gatsby
7,236,"unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive",Great Gatsby
7,237,"heat, leaving them out of sight behind.",Great Gatsby
7,238,“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.,Great Gatsby
7,239,“See what?”,Great Gatsby
7,240,"He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known",Great Gatsby
7,241,all along.,Great Gatsby
7,242,"“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am,",Great Gatsby
7,243,"but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to",Great Gatsby
7,244,"do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”",Great Gatsby
7,245,"He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back",Great Gatsby
7,246,from the edge of theoretical abyss.,Great Gatsby
7,247,"“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I",Great Gatsby
7,248,could have gone deeper if I’d known—”,Great Gatsby
7,249,“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.,Great Gatsby
7,250,"“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”",Great Gatsby
7,251,“About Gatsby.”,Great Gatsby
7,252,"“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small",Great Gatsby
7,253,investigation of his past.”,Great Gatsby
7,254,"“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.",Great Gatsby
7,255,“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink,Great Gatsby
7,256,suit.”,Great Gatsby
7,257,“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”,Great Gatsby
7,258,"“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like",Great Gatsby
7,259,that.”,Great Gatsby
7,260,"“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?”",Great Gatsby
7,261,demanded Jordan crossly.,Great Gatsby
7,262,“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows,Great Gatsby
7,263,where!”,Great Gatsby
7,264,"We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we",Great Gatsby
7,265,drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded,Great Gatsby
7,266,"eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution",Great Gatsby
7,267,about gasoline.,Great Gatsby
7,268,"“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.",Great Gatsby
7,269,"“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to",Great Gatsby
7,270,get stalled in this baking heat.”,Great Gatsby
7,271,"Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty",Great Gatsby
7,272,stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from,Great Gatsby
7,273,the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.,Great Gatsby
7,274,“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we,Great Gatsby
7,275,stopped for—to admire the view?”,Great Gatsby
7,276,"“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”",Great Gatsby
7,277,“What’s the matter?”,Great Gatsby
7,278,“I’m all run down.”,Great Gatsby
7,279,"“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on",Great Gatsby
7,280,the phone.”,Great Gatsby
7,281,"With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,",Great Gatsby
7,282,"breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his",Great Gatsby
7,283,face was green.,Great Gatsby
7,284,"“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money",Great Gatsby
7,285,"pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your",Great Gatsby
7,286,old car.”,Great Gatsby
7,287,“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”,Great Gatsby
7,288,"“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.",Great Gatsby
7,289,“Like to buy it?”,Great Gatsby
7,290,"“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money",Great Gatsby
7,291,on the other.”,Great Gatsby
7,292,"“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”",Great Gatsby
7,293,“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go,Great Gatsby
7,294,West.”,Great Gatsby
7,295,"“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.",Great Gatsby
7,296,“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment,Great Gatsby
7,297,"against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she",Great Gatsby
7,298,wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”,Great Gatsby
7,299,The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a,Great Gatsby
7,300,waving hand.,Great Gatsby
7,301,“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.,Great Gatsby
7,302,"“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked",Great Gatsby
7,303,Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering,Great Gatsby
7,304,you about the car.”,Great Gatsby
7,305,“What do I owe you?”,Great Gatsby
7,306,“Dollar twenty.”,Great Gatsby
7,307,The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a,Great Gatsby
7,308,bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t,Great Gatsby
7,309,alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life,Great Gatsby
7,310,"apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically",Great Gatsby
7,311,"sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel",Great Gatsby
7,312,discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there,Great Gatsby
7,313,"was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as",Great Gatsby
7,314,the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that,Great Gatsby
7,315,"he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor",Great Gatsby
7,316,girl with child.,Great Gatsby
7,317,"“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrow",Great Gatsby
7,318,afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
7,319,"That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare",Great Gatsby
7,320,"of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of",Great Gatsby
7,321,something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.,Great Gatsby
7,322,"Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that",Great Gatsby
7,323,other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than,Great Gatsby
7,324,twenty feet away.,Great Gatsby
7,325,In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved,Great Gatsby
7,326,"aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So",Great Gatsby
7,327,"engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and",Great Gatsby
7,328,one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a,Great Gatsby
7,329,slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it,Great Gatsby
7,330,"was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle",Great Gatsby
7,331,Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized,Great Gatsby
7,332,"that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on",Great Gatsby
7,333,"Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.",Great Gatsby
7,334,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
7,335,"There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we",Great Gatsby
7,336,drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his,Great Gatsby
7,337,"mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping",Great Gatsby
7,338,precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the,Great Gatsby
7,339,accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving,Great Gatsby
7,340,"Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an",Great Gatsby
7,341,"hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in",Great Gatsby
7,342,sight of the easygoing blue coupé.,Great Gatsby
7,343,"“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested",Great Gatsby
7,344,Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.,Great Gatsby
7,345,"There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of",Great Gatsby
7,346,funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”,Great Gatsby
7,347,"The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but",Great Gatsby
7,348,"before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy",Great Gatsby
7,349,signalled us to draw up alongside.,Great Gatsby
7,350,“Where are we going?” she cried.,Great Gatsby
7,351,“How about the movies?”,Great Gatsby
7,352,"“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you",Great Gatsby
7,353,after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some,Great Gatsby
7,354,corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”,Great Gatsby
7,355,"“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave",Great Gatsby
7,356,out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of,Great Gatsby
7,357,"Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”",Great Gatsby
7,358,"Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if",Great Gatsby
7,359,the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I,Great Gatsby
7,360,think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his,Great Gatsby
7,361,life forever.,Great Gatsby
7,362,But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging,Great Gatsby
7,363,the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.,Great Gatsby
7,364,The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into,Great Gatsby
7,365,"that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in",Great Gatsby
7,366,"the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around",Great Gatsby
7,367,my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.,Great Gatsby
7,368,The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five,Great Gatsby
7,369,"bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as",Great Gatsby
7,370,“a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it,Great Gatsby
7,371,was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and,Great Gatsby
7,372,"thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …",Great Gatsby
7,373,"The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four",Great Gatsby
7,374,"o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery",Great Gatsby
7,375,"from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,",Great Gatsby
7,376,fixing her hair.,Great Gatsby
7,377,"“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone",Great Gatsby
7,378,laughed.,Great Gatsby
7,379,"“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.",Great Gatsby
7,380,“There aren’t any more.”,Great Gatsby
7,381,"“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”",Great Gatsby
7,382,"“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.",Great Gatsby
7,383,“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”,Great Gatsby
7,384,He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the,Great Gatsby
7,385,table.,Great Gatsby
7,386,"“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one",Great Gatsby
7,387,that wanted to come to town.”,Great Gatsby
7,388,There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its,Great Gatsby
7,389,"nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse",Great Gatsby
7,390,me”—but this time no one laughed.,Great Gatsby
7,391,"“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.",Great Gatsby
7,392,"“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in",Great Gatsby
7,393,"an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.",Great Gatsby
7,394,"“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.",Great Gatsby
7,395,“What is?”,Great Gatsby
7,396,“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”,Great Gatsby
7,397,"“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if",Great Gatsby
7,398,you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.,Great Gatsby
7,399,Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”,Great Gatsby
7,400,As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound,Great Gatsby
7,401,and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s,Great Gatsby
7,402,Wedding March from the ballroom below.,Great Gatsby
7,403,“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.,Great Gatsby
7,404,"“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.",Great Gatsby
7,405,"“Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”",Great Gatsby
7,406,"“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.",Great Gatsby
7,407,"“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a",Great Gatsby
7,408,"fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”",Great Gatsby
7,409,"“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived",Great Gatsby
7,410,"just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy",Great Gatsby
7,411,told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.”  After,Great Gatsby
7,412,a moment she added. “There wasn’t any connection.”,Great Gatsby
7,413,"“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.",Great Gatsby
7,414,“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he,Great Gatsby
7,415,left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”,Great Gatsby
7,416,The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer,Great Gatsby
7,417,"floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of",Great Gatsby
7,418,“Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.,Great Gatsby
7,419,"“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and",Great Gatsby
7,420,dance.”,Great Gatsby
7,421,"“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”",Great Gatsby
7,422,“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a,Great Gatsby
7,423,friend of Daisy’s.”,Great Gatsby
7,424,"“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in",Great Gatsby
7,425,the private car.”,Great Gatsby
7,426,"“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa",Great Gatsby
7,427,Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room,Great Gatsby
7,428,for him.”,Great Gatsby
7,429,Jordan smiled.,Great Gatsby
7,430,“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of,Great Gatsby
7,431,your class at Yale.”,Great Gatsby
7,432,Tom and I looked at each other blankly.,Great Gatsby
7,433,“Biloxi?”,Great Gatsby
7,434,"“First place, we didn’t have any president—”",Great Gatsby
7,435,"Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.",Great Gatsby
7,436,"“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”",Great Gatsby
7,437,“Not exactly.”,Great Gatsby
7,438,"“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”",Great Gatsby
7,439,“Yes—I went there.”,Great Gatsby
7,440,"A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:",Great Gatsby
7,441,“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”,Great Gatsby
7,442,Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice,Great Gatsby
7,443,but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing,Great Gatsby
7,444,of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.,Great Gatsby
7,445,"“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.",Great Gatsby
7,446,"“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”",Great Gatsby
7,447,"“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I",Great Gatsby
7,448,can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”,Great Gatsby
7,449,Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all,Great Gatsby
7,450,looking at Gatsby.,Great Gatsby
7,451,“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the,Great Gatsby
7,452,"armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in",Great Gatsby
7,453,England or France.”,Great Gatsby
7,454,I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those,Great Gatsby
7,455,renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.,Great Gatsby
7,456,"Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.",Great Gatsby
7,457,"“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.",Great Gatsby
7,458,Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!”,Great Gatsby
7,459,"“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more",Great Gatsby
7,460,question.”,Great Gatsby
7,461,"“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.",Great Gatsby
7,462,“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”,Great Gatsby
7,463,They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.,Great Gatsby
7,464,"“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the",Great Gatsby
7,465,other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”,Great Gatsby
7,466,“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest,Great Gatsby
7,467,thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your,Great Gatsby
7,468,"wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people",Great Gatsby
7,469,"begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next",Great Gatsby
7,470,they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between,Great Gatsby
7,471,black and white.”,Great Gatsby
7,472,"Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone",Great Gatsby
7,473,on the last barrier of civilization.,Great Gatsby
7,474,"“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.",Great Gatsby
7,475,“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose,Great Gatsby
7,476,you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any,Great Gatsby
7,477,friends—in the modern world.”,Great Gatsby
7,478,"Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he",Great Gatsby
7,479,opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so,Great Gatsby
7,480,complete.,Great Gatsby
7,481,"“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy",Great Gatsby
7,482,guessed at his intention.,Great Gatsby
7,483,“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go,Great Gatsby
7,484,home. Why don’t we all go home?”,Great Gatsby
7,485,"“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”",Great Gatsby
7,486,“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”,Great Gatsby
7,487,"“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you.",Great Gatsby
7,488,She loves me.”,Great Gatsby
7,489,“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.,Great Gatsby
7,490,"Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.",Great Gatsby
7,491,"“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you",Great Gatsby
7,492,because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a,Great Gatsby
7,493,"terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”",Great Gatsby
7,494,"At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted",Great Gatsby
7,495,with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had,Great Gatsby
7,496,anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously,Great Gatsby
7,497,of their emotions.,Great Gatsby
7,498,"“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal",Great Gatsby
7,499,note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”,Great Gatsby
7,500,"“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five",Great Gatsby
7,501,years—and you didn’t know.”,Great Gatsby
7,502,Tom turned to Daisy sharply.,Great Gatsby
7,503,“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”,Great Gatsby
7,504,"“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved",Great Gatsby
7,505,"each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to",Great Gatsby
7,506,laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that,Great Gatsby
7,507,you didn’t know.”,Great Gatsby
7,508,“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a,Great Gatsby
7,509,clergyman and leaned back in his chair.,Great Gatsby
7,510,“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five,Great Gatsby
7,511,"years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I",Great Gatsby
7,512,see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries,Great Gatsby
7,513,to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy,Great Gatsby
7,514,loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”,Great Gatsby
7,515,"“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.",Great Gatsby
7,516,"“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish",Great Gatsby
7,517,ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded,Great Gatsby
7,518,"sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off",Great Gatsby
7,519,"on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in",Great Gatsby
7,520,my heart I love her all the time.”,Great Gatsby
7,521,"“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,",Great Gatsby
7,522,"dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do",Great Gatsby
7,523,you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you,Great Gatsby
7,524,to the story of that little spree.”,Great Gatsby
7,525,Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.,Great Gatsby
7,526,"“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter",Great Gatsby
7,527,any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s,Great Gatsby
7,528,all wiped out forever.”,Great Gatsby
7,529,She looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”,Great Gatsby
7,530,“You never loved him.”,Great Gatsby
7,531,"She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,",Great Gatsby
7,532,as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she,Great Gatsby
7,533,"had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done",Great Gatsby
7,534,now. It was too late.,Great Gatsby
7,535,"“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.",Great Gatsby
7,536,“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.,Great Gatsby
7,537,“No.”,Great Gatsby
7,538,"From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were",Great Gatsby
7,539,drifting up on hot waves of air.,Great Gatsby
7,540,“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your,Great Gatsby
7,541,shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy?”,Great Gatsby
7,542,"“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.",Great Gatsby
7,543,"She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried",Great Gatsby
7,544,to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette,Great Gatsby
7,545,and the burning match on the carpet.,Great Gatsby
7,546,"“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t",Great Gatsby
7,547,that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob,Great Gatsby
7,548,helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”,Great Gatsby
7,549,Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.,Great Gatsby
7,550,“You loved me too?” he repeated.,Great Gatsby
7,551,"“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were",Great Gatsby
7,552,"alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,",Great Gatsby
7,553,things that neither of us can ever forget.”,Great Gatsby
7,554,The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.,Great Gatsby
7,555,"“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited",Great Gatsby
7,556,now—”,Great Gatsby
7,557,"“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful",Great Gatsby
7,558,voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”,Great Gatsby
7,559,"“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.",Great Gatsby
7,560,She turned to her husband.,Great Gatsby
7,561,"“As if it mattered to you,” she said.",Great Gatsby
7,562,“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now,Great Gatsby
7,563,on.”,Great Gatsby
7,564,"“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re",Great Gatsby
7,565,not going to take care of her any more.”,Great Gatsby
7,566,“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to,Great Gatsby
7,567,control himself now. “Why’s that?”,Great Gatsby
7,568,“Daisy’s leaving you.”,Great Gatsby
7,569,“Nonsense.”,Great Gatsby
7,570,"“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.",Great Gatsby
7,571,“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.,Great Gatsby
7,572,“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he,Great Gatsby
7,573,put on her finger.”,Great Gatsby
7,574,"“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”",Great Gatsby
7,575,"“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that",Great Gatsby
7,576,hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve,Great Gatsby
7,577,made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it,Great Gatsby
7,578,further tomorrow.”,Great Gatsby
7,579,"“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.",Great Gatsby
7,580,“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke,Great Gatsby
7,581,rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street,Great Gatsby
7,582,drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the,Great Gatsby
7,583,counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a,Great Gatsby
7,584,"bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”",Great Gatsby
7,585,“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter,Great Gatsby
7,586,Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”,Great Gatsby
7,587,"“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for",Great Gatsby
7,588,a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the,Great Gatsby
7,589,subject of you.”,Great Gatsby
7,590,"“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old",Great Gatsby
7,591,sport.”,Great Gatsby
7,592,“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said,Great Gatsby
7,593,"nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but",Great Gatsby
7,594,Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”,Great Gatsby
7,595,That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.,Great Gatsby
7,596,"“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,",Great Gatsby
7,597,“but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me,Great Gatsby
7,598,about.”,Great Gatsby
7,599,"I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her",Great Gatsby
7,600,"husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but",Great Gatsby
7,601,absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to,Great Gatsby
7,602,Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said,Great Gatsby
7,603,in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had,Great Gatsby
7,604,“killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in,Great Gatsby
7,605,just that fantastic way.,Great Gatsby
7,606,"It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying",Great Gatsby
7,607,"everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been",Great Gatsby
7,608,made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into,Great Gatsby
7,609,"herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the",Great Gatsby
7,610,"afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,",Great Gatsby
7,611,"struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across",Great Gatsby
7,612,the room.,Great Gatsby
7,613,The voice begged again to go.,Great Gatsby
7,614,"“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”",Great Gatsby
7,615,"Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage",Great Gatsby
7,616,"she had had, were definitely gone.",Great Gatsby
7,617,"“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”",Great Gatsby
7,618,"She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous",Great Gatsby
7,619,scorn.,Great Gatsby
7,620,“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous,Great Gatsby
7,621,little flirtation is over.”,Great Gatsby
7,622,"They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,",Great Gatsby
7,623,"isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.",Great Gatsby
7,624,After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of,Great Gatsby
7,625,whisky in the towel.,Great Gatsby
7,626,“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”,Great Gatsby
7,627,I didn’t answer.,Great Gatsby
7,628,“Nick?” He asked again.,Great Gatsby
7,629,“What?”,Great Gatsby
7,630,“Want any?”,Great Gatsby
7,631,“No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”,Great Gatsby
7,632,"I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a",Great Gatsby
7,633,new decade.,Great Gatsby
7,634,It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started,Great Gatsby
7,635,"for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but",Great Gatsby
7,636,his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on,Great Gatsby
7,637,the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy,Great Gatsby
7,638,"has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments",Great Gatsby
7,639,fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of,Great Gatsby
7,640,"loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning",Great Gatsby
7,641,"briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside",Great Gatsby
7,642,"me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten",Great Gatsby
7,643,dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face,Great Gatsby
7,644,fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of,Great Gatsby
7,645,thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.,Great Gatsby
7,646,So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.,Great Gatsby
7,647,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
7,648,"The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the",Great Gatsby
7,649,ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept,Great Gatsby
7,650,"through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the",Great Gatsby
7,651,"garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale",Great Gatsby
7,652,as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go,Great Gatsby
7,653,"to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if",Great Gatsby
7,654,he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent,Great Gatsby
7,655,racket broke out overhead.,Great Gatsby
7,656,"“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.",Great Gatsby
7,657,"“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re",Great Gatsby
7,658,going to move away.”,Great Gatsby
7,659,"Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and",Great Gatsby
7,660,Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.,Great Gatsby
7,661,"Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he",Great Gatsby
7,662,sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars,Great Gatsby
7,663,that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably,Great Gatsby
7,664,"laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not",Great Gatsby
7,665,his own.,Great Gatsby
7,666,"So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson",Great Gatsby
7,667,"wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious",Great Gatsby
7,668,glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain,Great Gatsby
7,669,"times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some",Great Gatsby
7,670,"workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis",Great Gatsby
7,671,"took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he",Great Gatsby
7,672,"didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside",Great Gatsby
7,673,"again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation",Great Gatsby
7,674,"because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in",Great Gatsby
7,675,the garage.,Great Gatsby
7,676,"“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty",Great Gatsby
7,677,little coward!”,Great Gatsby
7,678,"A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and",Great Gatsby
7,679,shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.,Great Gatsby
7,680,"The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out",Great Gatsby
7,681,"of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then",Great Gatsby
7,682,disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of,Great Gatsby
7,683,its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The,Great Gatsby
7,684,"other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards",Great Gatsby
7,685,"beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life",Great Gatsby
7,686,"violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark",Great Gatsby
7,687,blood with the dust.,Great Gatsby
7,688,"Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open",Great Gatsby
7,689,"her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left",Great Gatsby
7,690,"breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen",Great Gatsby
7,691,for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at,Great Gatsby
7,692,"the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the",Great Gatsby
7,693,tremendous vitality she had stored so long.,Great Gatsby
7,694,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
7,695,We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still,Great Gatsby
7,696,some distance away.,Great Gatsby
7,697,“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at,Great Gatsby
7,698,last.”,Great Gatsby
7,699,"He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as",Great Gatsby
7,700,"we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage",Great Gatsby
7,701,door made him automatically put on the brakes.,Great Gatsby
7,702,"“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”",Great Gatsby
7,703,"I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly",Great Gatsby
7,704,"from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked",Great Gatsby
7,705,"toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered",Great Gatsby
7,706,over and over in a gasping moan.,Great Gatsby
7,707,"“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.",Great Gatsby
7,708,He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the,Great Gatsby
7,709,"garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal",Great Gatsby
7,710,"basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a",Great Gatsby
7,711,violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way,Great Gatsby
7,712,through.,Great Gatsby
7,713,The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it,Great Gatsby
7,714,was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals,Great Gatsby
7,715,"deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.",Great Gatsby
7,716,"Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another",Great Gatsby
7,717,"blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on",Great Gatsby
7,718,"a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending",Great Gatsby
7,719,"over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking",Great Gatsby
7,720,down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I,Great Gatsby
7,721,"couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed",Great Gatsby
7,722,clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the,Great Gatsby
7,723,"raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to",Great Gatsby
7,724,the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low,Great Gatsby
7,725,"voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his",Great Gatsby
7,726,"shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly",Great Gatsby
7,727,"from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk",Great Gatsby
7,728,"back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,",Great Gatsby
7,729,horrible call:,Great Gatsby
7,730,"“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”",Great Gatsby
7,731,"Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around",Great Gatsby
7,732,"the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to",Great Gatsby
7,733,the policeman.,Great Gatsby
7,734,"“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”",Great Gatsby
7,735,"“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”",Great Gatsby
7,736,“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.,Great Gatsby
7,737,"“r—” said the policeman, “o—”",Great Gatsby
7,738,“g—”,Great Gatsby
7,739,“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.,Great Gatsby
7,740,"“What you want, fella?”",Great Gatsby
7,741,“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”,Great Gatsby
7,742,“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”,Great Gatsby
7,743,"“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.",Great Gatsby
7,744,“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”,Great Gatsby
7,745,"“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”",Great Gatsby
7,746,“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.,Great Gatsby
7,747,"“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but",Great Gatsby
7,748,stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one,Great Gatsby
7,749,"comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles",Great Gatsby
7,750,an hour.”,Great Gatsby
7,751,“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.,Great Gatsby
7,752,“Hasn’t got any name.”,Great Gatsby
7,753,A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.,Great Gatsby
7,754,"“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”",Great Gatsby
7,755,“See the accident?” asked the policeman.,Great Gatsby
7,756,"“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going",Great Gatsby
7,757,"fifty, sixty.”",Great Gatsby
7,758,“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his,Great Gatsby
7,759,name.”,Great Gatsby
7,760,"Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in",Great Gatsby
7,761,"the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his",Great Gatsby
7,762,grasping cries:,Great Gatsby
7,763,“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind,Great Gatsby
7,764,of car it was!”,Great Gatsby
7,765,"Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten",Great Gatsby
7,766,"under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in",Great Gatsby
7,767,"front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.",Great Gatsby
7,768,"“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing",Great Gatsby
7,769,gruffness.,Great Gatsby
7,770,Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then,Great Gatsby
7,771,would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.,Great Gatsby
7,772,"“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute",Great Gatsby
7,773,"ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking",Great Gatsby
7,774,about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you,Great Gatsby
7,775,hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
7,776,"Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the",Great Gatsby
7,777,policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent,Great Gatsby
7,778,eyes.,Great Gatsby
7,779,“What’s all that?” he demanded.,Great Gatsby
7,780,“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on,Great Gatsby
7,781,Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow,Great Gatsby
7,782,car.”,Great Gatsby
7,783,Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.,Great Gatsby
7,784,“And what colour’s your car?”,Great Gatsby
7,785,"“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”",Great Gatsby
7,786,"“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.",Great Gatsby
7,787,"Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and",Great Gatsby
7,788,the policeman turned away.,Great Gatsby
7,789,"“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”",Great Gatsby
7,790,"Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set",Great Gatsby
7,791,"him down in a chair, and came back.",Great Gatsby
7,792,"“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped",Great Gatsby
7,793,authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced,Great Gatsby
7,794,at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the,Great Gatsby
7,795,"door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the",Great Gatsby
7,796,table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”,Great Gatsby
7,797,"Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we",Great Gatsby
7,798,"pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,",Great Gatsby
7,799,"case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.",Great Gatsby
7,800,Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down,Great Gatsby
7,801,"hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I",Great Gatsby
7,802,"heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down",Great Gatsby
7,803,his face.,Great Gatsby
7,804,“The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”,Great Gatsby
7,805,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
7,806,The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark,Great Gatsby
7,807,rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the,Great Gatsby
7,808,"second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.",Great Gatsby
7,809,"“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and",Great Gatsby
7,810,frowned slightly.,Great Gatsby
7,811,"“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can",Great Gatsby
7,812,do tonight.”,Great Gatsby
7,813,"A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.",Great Gatsby
7,814,As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of,Great Gatsby
7,815,the situation in a few brisk phrases.,Great Gatsby
7,816,"“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting",Great Gatsby
7,817,you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some,Great Gatsby
7,818,supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”,Great Gatsby
7,819,"“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait",Great Gatsby
7,820,outside.”,Great Gatsby
7,821,Jordan put her hand on my arm.,Great Gatsby
7,822,"“Won’t you come in, Nick?”",Great Gatsby
7,823,"“No, thanks.”",Great Gatsby
7,824,I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan,Great Gatsby
7,825,lingered for a moment more.,Great Gatsby
7,826,"“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.",Great Gatsby
7,827,"I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,",Great Gatsby
7,828,and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of,Great Gatsby
7,829,"this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the",Great Gatsby
7,830,porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head,Great Gatsby
7,831,"in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s",Great Gatsby
7,832,voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from,Great Gatsby
7,833,"the house, intending to wait by the gate.",Great Gatsby
7,834,I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped,Great Gatsby
7,835,from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird,Great Gatsby
7,836,"by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity",Great Gatsby
7,837,of his pink suit under the moon.,Great Gatsby
7,838,“What are you doing?” I inquired.,Great Gatsby
7,839,"“Just standing here, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
7,840,"Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was",Great Gatsby
7,841,going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to,Great Gatsby
7,842,"see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in",Great Gatsby
7,843,the dark shrubbery.,Great Gatsby
7,844,“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.,Great Gatsby
7,845,“Yes.”,Great Gatsby
7,846,He hesitated.,Great Gatsby
7,847,“Was she killed?”,Great Gatsby
7,848,“Yes.”,Great Gatsby
7,849,“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock,Great Gatsby
7,850,should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”,Great Gatsby
7,851,He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.,Great Gatsby
7,852,"“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in",Great Gatsby
7,853,"my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be",Great Gatsby
7,854,sure.”,Great Gatsby
7,855,I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to,Great Gatsby
7,856,tell him he was wrong.,Great Gatsby
7,857,“Who was the woman?” he inquired.,Great Gatsby
7,858,“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did,Great Gatsby
7,859,it happen?”,Great Gatsby
7,860,"“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I",Great Gatsby
7,861,guessed at the truth.,Great Gatsby
7,862,“Was Daisy driving?”,Great Gatsby
7,863,"“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see,",Great Gatsby
7,864,when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would,Great Gatsby
7,865,steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were,Great Gatsby
7,866,"passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but",Great Gatsby
7,867,"it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were",Great Gatsby
7,868,"somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward",Great Gatsby
7,869,"the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second",Great Gatsby
7,870,my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her,Great Gatsby
7,871,instantly.”,Great Gatsby
7,872,“It ripped her open—”,Great Gatsby
7,873,"“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I",Great Gatsby
7,874,"tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency",Great Gatsby
7,875,brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.,Great Gatsby
7,876,"“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to",Great Gatsby
7,877,wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness,Great Gatsby
7,878,"this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries",Great Gatsby
7,879,any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”,Great Gatsby
7,880,"“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”",Great Gatsby
7,881,"“I don’t trust him, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
7,882,“How long are you going to wait?”,Great Gatsby
7,883,"“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”",Great Gatsby
7,884,A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy,Great Gatsby
7,885,had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might,Great Gatsby
7,886,think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright,Great Gatsby
7,887,windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground,Great Gatsby
7,888,floor.,Great Gatsby
7,889,"“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a",Great Gatsby
7,890,commotion.”,Great Gatsby
7,891,"I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel",Great Gatsby
7,892,"softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains",Great Gatsby
7,893,"were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where",Great Gatsby
7,894,"we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small",Great Gatsby
7,895,rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind,Great Gatsby
7,896,"was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.",Great Gatsby
7,897,"Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,",Great Gatsby
7,898,"with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of",Great Gatsby
7,899,"ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his",Great Gatsby
7,900,earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a,Great Gatsby
7,901,while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.,Great Gatsby
7,902,"They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the",Great Gatsby
7,903,ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air,Great Gatsby
7,904,"of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said",Great Gatsby
7,905,that they were conspiring together.,Great Gatsby
7,906,As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the,Great Gatsby
7,907,dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in,Great Gatsby
7,908,the drive.,Great Gatsby
7,909,“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.,Great Gatsby
7,910,"“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get",Great Gatsby
7,911,some sleep.”,Great Gatsby
7,912,He shook his head.,Great Gatsby
7,913,"“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
7,914,He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his,Great Gatsby
7,915,"scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of",Great Gatsby
7,916,the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the,Great Gatsby
7,917,moonlight—watching over nothing.,Great Gatsby
8,0,I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the,Great Gatsby
8,1,"Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,",Great Gatsby
8,2,"frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,",Great Gatsby
8,3,and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I,Great Gatsby
8,4,"had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning",Great Gatsby
8,5,would be too late.,Great Gatsby
8,6,"Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was",Great Gatsby
8,7,"leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.",Great Gatsby
8,8,"“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock",Great Gatsby
8,9,she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned,Great Gatsby
8,10,out the light.”,Great Gatsby
8,11,His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when,Great Gatsby
8,12,we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside,Great Gatsby
8,13,"curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of",Great Gatsby
8,14,dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of,Great Gatsby
8,15,splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable,Great Gatsby
8,16,"amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they",Great Gatsby
8,17,hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar,Great Gatsby
8,18,"table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French",Great Gatsby
8,19,"windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.",Great Gatsby
8,20,"“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace",Great Gatsby
8,21,your car.”,Great Gatsby
8,22,"“Go away now, old sport?”",Great Gatsby
8,23,"“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”",Great Gatsby
8,24,He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he,Great Gatsby
8,25,knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and,Great Gatsby
8,26,I couldn’t bear to shake him free.,Great Gatsby
8,27,It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with,Great Gatsby
8,28,Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass,Great Gatsby
8,29,"against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played",Great Gatsby
8,30,"out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without",Great Gatsby
8,31,"reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.",Great Gatsby
8,32,She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed,Great Gatsby
8,33,"capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with",Great Gatsby
8,34,indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly,Great Gatsby
8,35,"desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from",Great Gatsby
8,36,"Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a",Great Gatsby
8,37,beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless,Great Gatsby
8,38,"intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her",Great Gatsby
8,39,"as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,",Great Gatsby
8,40,a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other,Great Gatsby
8,41,"bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its",Great Gatsby
8,42,"corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already",Great Gatsby
8,43,in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s,Great Gatsby
8,44,shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely,Great Gatsby
8,45,"withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved",Great Gatsby
8,46,Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all,Great Gatsby
8,47,"about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still",Great Gatsby
8,48,vibrant emotions.,Great Gatsby
8,49,But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal,Great Gatsby
8,50,"accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was",Great Gatsby
8,51,"at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the",Great Gatsby
8,52,invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he,Great Gatsby
8,53,"made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and",Great Gatsby
8,54,"unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took",Great Gatsby
8,55,her because he had no real right to touch her hand.,Great Gatsby
8,56,"He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under",Great Gatsby
8,57,false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom,Great Gatsby
8,58,"millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he",Great Gatsby
8,59,let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as,Great Gatsby
8,60,herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of,Great Gatsby
8,61,"fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing",Great Gatsby
8,62,"behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government",Great Gatsby
8,63,to be blown anywhere about the world.,Great Gatsby
8,64,But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had,Great Gatsby
8,65,"imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but",Great Gatsby
8,66,now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a,Great Gatsby
8,67,"grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize",Great Gatsby
8,68,just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her,Great Gatsby
8,69,"rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt",Great Gatsby
8,70,"married to her, that was all.",Great Gatsby
8,71,"When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,",Great Gatsby
8,72,"who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought",Great Gatsby
8,73,luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as,Great Gatsby
8,74,she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She,Great Gatsby
8,75,"had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming",Great Gatsby
8,76,"than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and",Great Gatsby
8,77,"mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many",Great Gatsby
8,78,"clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the",Great Gatsby
8,79,hot struggles of the poor.,Great Gatsby
8,80,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,81,"“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,",Great Gatsby
8,82,"old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she",Great Gatsby
8,83,"didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot",Great Gatsby
8,84,"because I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off",Great Gatsby
8,85,"my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden",Great Gatsby
8,86,I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have,Great Gatsby
8,87,a better time telling her what I was going to do?”,Great Gatsby
8,88,"On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his",Great Gatsby
8,89,"arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the",Great Gatsby
8,90,room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his,Great Gatsby
8,91,"arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon",Great Gatsby
8,92,"had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory",Great Gatsby
8,93,for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer,Great Gatsby
8,94,"in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with",Great Gatsby
8,95,"another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder",Great Gatsby
8,96,"or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were",Great Gatsby
8,97,asleep.,Great Gatsby
8,98,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,99,He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he,Great Gatsby
8,100,"went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his",Great Gatsby
8,101,majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the,Great Gatsby
8,102,"armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or",Great Gatsby
8,103,misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there,Great Gatsby
8,104,was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see,Great Gatsby
8,105,why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world,Great Gatsby
8,106,"outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her",Great Gatsby
8,107,and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.,Great Gatsby
8,108,For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids,Great Gatsby
8,109,"and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of",Great Gatsby
8,110,"the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new",Great Gatsby
8,111,tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the,Great Gatsby
8,112,“Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver,Great Gatsby
8,113,slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were,Great Gatsby
8,114,"always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,",Great Gatsby
8,115,while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the,Great Gatsby
8,116,sad horns around the floor.,Great Gatsby
8,117,Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the,Great Gatsby
8,118,season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with,Great Gatsby
8,119,"half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and",Great Gatsby
8,120,chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor,Great Gatsby
8,121,beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a,Great Gatsby
8,122,"decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision",Great Gatsby
8,123,"must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable",Great Gatsby
8,124,practicality—that was close at hand.,Great Gatsby
8,125,That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom,Great Gatsby
8,126,Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his,Great Gatsby
8,127,"position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain",Great Gatsby
8,128,struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was,Great Gatsby
8,129,still at Oxford.,Great Gatsby
8,130,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,131,It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of,Great Gatsby
8,132,"the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,",Great Gatsby
8,133,gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew,Great Gatsby
8,134,and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a,Great Gatsby
8,135,"slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,",Great Gatsby
8,136,lovely day.,Great Gatsby
8,137,“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window,Great Gatsby
8,138,"and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was",Great Gatsby
8,139,very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that,Great Gatsby
8,140,frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap,Great Gatsby
8,141,sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”,Great Gatsby
8,142,He sat down gloomily.,Great Gatsby
8,143,"“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were",Great Gatsby
8,144,"first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”",Great Gatsby
8,145,Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.,Great Gatsby
8,146,"“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”",Great Gatsby
8,147,"What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his",Great Gatsby
8,148,conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?,Great Gatsby
8,149,He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their,Great Gatsby
8,150,"wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to",Great Gatsby
8,151,"Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,",Great Gatsby
8,152,walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through,Great Gatsby
8,153,the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which,Great Gatsby
8,154,they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always,Great Gatsby
8,155,"seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea",Great Gatsby
8,156,"of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded",Great Gatsby
8,157,with a melancholy beauty.,Great Gatsby
8,158,"He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found",Great Gatsby
8,159,her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless,Great Gatsby
8,160,now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a,Great Gatsby
8,161,"folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar",Great Gatsby
8,162,"buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow",Great Gatsby
8,163,trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have,Great Gatsby
8,164,seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.,Great Gatsby
8,165,"The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it",Great Gatsby
8,166,"sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing",Great Gatsby
8,167,city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand,Great Gatsby
8,168,"desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of",Great Gatsby
8,169,the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too,Great Gatsby
8,170,fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part,Great Gatsby
8,171,"of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",Great Gatsby
8,172,It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the,Great Gatsby
8,173,porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there,Great Gatsby
8,174,"was an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of",Great Gatsby
8,175,"Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.",Great Gatsby
8,176,"“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start",Great Gatsby
8,177,"falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”",Great Gatsby
8,178,"“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.",Great Gatsby
8,179,"“You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”",Great Gatsby
8,180,I looked at my watch and stood up.,Great Gatsby
8,181,“Twelve minutes to my train.”,Great Gatsby
8,182,I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of,Great Gatsby
8,183,"work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I",Great Gatsby
8,184,"missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.",Great Gatsby
8,185,"“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.",Great Gatsby
8,186,"“Do, old sport.”",Great Gatsby
8,187,“I’ll call you about noon.”,Great Gatsby
8,188,We walked slowly down the steps.,Great Gatsby
8,189,"“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he",Great Gatsby
8,190,hoped I’d corroborate this.,Great Gatsby
8,191,“I suppose so.”,Great Gatsby
8,192,"“Well, goodbye.”",Great Gatsby
8,193,We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I,Great Gatsby
8,194,remembered something and turned around.,Great Gatsby
8,195,"“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the",Great Gatsby
8,196,whole damn bunch put together.”,Great Gatsby
8,197,I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever,Great Gatsby
8,198,"gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he",Great Gatsby
8,199,"nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and",Great Gatsby
8,200,"understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact",Great Gatsby
8,201,all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of,Great Gatsby
8,202,"colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I",Great Gatsby
8,203,"first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and",Great Gatsby
8,204,drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his,Great Gatsby
8,205,"corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his",Great Gatsby
8,206,"incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.",Great Gatsby
8,207,I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for,Great Gatsby
8,208,that—I and the others.,Great Gatsby
8,209,"“Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”",Great Gatsby
8,210,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,211,"Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an",Great Gatsby
8,212,"interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.",Great Gatsby
8,213,"Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat",Great Gatsby
8,214,breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me,Great Gatsby
8,215,up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between,Great Gatsby
8,216,hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other,Great Gatsby
8,217,"way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,",Great Gatsby
8,218,as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the,Great Gatsby
8,219,"office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.",Great Gatsby
8,220,"“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going",Great Gatsby
8,221,down to Southampton this afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
8,222,"Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act",Great Gatsby
8,223,"annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.",Great Gatsby
8,224,“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”,Great Gatsby
8,225,“How could it have mattered then?”,Great Gatsby
8,226,Silence for a moment. Then:,Great Gatsby
8,227,“However—I want to see you.”,Great Gatsby
8,228,"“I want to see you, too.”",Great Gatsby
8,229,"“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this",Great Gatsby
8,230,afternoon?”,Great Gatsby
8,231,“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
8,232,“Very well.”,Great Gatsby
8,233,“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”,Great Gatsby
8,234,"We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking",Great Gatsby
8,235,"any longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I",Great Gatsby
8,236,know I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table,Great Gatsby
8,237,that day if I never talked to her again in this world.,Great Gatsby
8,238,"I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I",Great Gatsby
8,239,tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was,Great Gatsby
8,240,being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my,Great Gatsby
8,241,"timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I",Great Gatsby
8,242,leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.,Great Gatsby
8,243,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,244,When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed,Great Gatsby
8,245,deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a,Great Gatsby
8,246,curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark,Great Gatsby
8,247,"spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what",Great Gatsby
8,248,"had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he",Great Gatsby
8,249,"could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was",Great Gatsby
8,250,forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at,Great Gatsby
8,251,the garage after we left there the night before.,Great Gatsby
8,252,"They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have",Great Gatsby
8,253,"broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she",Great Gatsby
8,254,was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had,Great Gatsby
8,255,"already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she",Great Gatsby
8,256,"immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the",Great Gatsby
8,257,"affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in",Great Gatsby
8,258,the wake of her sister’s body.,Great Gatsby
8,259,Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front,Great Gatsby
8,260,"of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on",Great Gatsby
8,261,"the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and",Great Gatsby
8,262,everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.,Great Gatsby
8,263,"Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis",Great Gatsby
8,264,"and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later",Great Gatsby
8,265,two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger,Great Gatsby
8,266,"to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own",Great Gatsby
8,267,"place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with",Great Gatsby
8,268,Wilson until dawn.,Great Gatsby
8,269,About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering,Great Gatsby
8,270,changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He,Great Gatsby
8,271,announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car,Great Gatsby
8,272,"belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his",Great Gatsby
8,273,wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose,Great Gatsby
8,274,swollen.,Great Gatsby
8,275,"But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,",Great Gatsby
8,276,my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt,Great Gatsby
8,277,to distract him.,Great Gatsby
8,278,"“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit",Great Gatsby
8,279,"still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been",Great Gatsby
8,280,married?”,Great Gatsby
8,281,“Twelve years.”,Great Gatsby
8,282,"“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a",Great Gatsby
8,283,question. Did you ever have any children?”,Great Gatsby
8,284,"The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and",Great Gatsby
8,285,whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it,Great Gatsby
8,286,sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.,Great Gatsby
8,287,"He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was",Great Gatsby
8,288,"stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably",Great Gatsby
8,289,around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from,Great Gatsby
8,290,time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.,Great Gatsby
8,291,"“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you",Great Gatsby
8,292,haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church,Great Gatsby
8,293,"and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”",Great Gatsby
8,294,“Don’t belong to any.”,Great Gatsby
8,295,"“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must",Great Gatsby
8,296,"have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen,",Great Gatsby
8,297,"George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”",Great Gatsby
8,298,“That was a long time ago.”,Great Gatsby
8,299,The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment,Great Gatsby
8,300,"he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came",Great Gatsby
8,301,back into his faded eyes.,Great Gatsby
8,302,"“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.",Great Gatsby
8,303,“Which drawer?”,Great Gatsby
8,304,“That drawer—that one.”,Great Gatsby
8,305,Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it,Great Gatsby
8,306,"but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided",Great Gatsby
8,307,silver. It was apparently new.,Great Gatsby
8,308,"“This?” he inquired, holding it up.",Great Gatsby
8,309,Wilson stared and nodded.,Great Gatsby
8,310,"“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I",Great Gatsby
8,311,knew it was something funny.”,Great Gatsby
8,312,“You mean your wife bought it?”,Great Gatsby
8,313,“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”,Great Gatsby
8,314,"Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen",Great Gatsby
8,315,reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably,Great Gatsby
8,316,"Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,",Great Gatsby
8,317,"because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter",Great Gatsby
8,318,left several explanations in the air.,Great Gatsby
8,319,"“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.",Great Gatsby
8,320,“Who did?”,Great Gatsby
8,321,“I have a way of finding out.”,Great Gatsby
8,322,"“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to",Great Gatsby
8,323,you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit,Great Gatsby
8,324,quiet till morning.”,Great Gatsby
8,325,“He murdered her.”,Great Gatsby
8,326,"“It was an accident, George.”",Great Gatsby
8,327,Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened,Great Gatsby
8,328,slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”,Great Gatsby
8,329,"“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I",Great Gatsby
8,330,"don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know",Great Gatsby
8,331,it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he,Great Gatsby
8,332,wouldn’t stop.”,Great Gatsby
8,333,"Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there",Great Gatsby
8,334,was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had,Great Gatsby
8,335,"been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any",Great Gatsby
8,336,particular car.,Great Gatsby
8,337,“How could she of been like that?”,Great Gatsby
8,338,"“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.",Great Gatsby
8,339,“Ah-h-h—”,Great Gatsby
8,340,"He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his",Great Gatsby
8,341,hand.,Great Gatsby
8,342,"“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”",Great Gatsby
8,343,This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:,Great Gatsby
8,344,there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later,Great Gatsby
8,345,"when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,",Great Gatsby
8,346,and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue,Great Gatsby
8,347,enough outside to snap off the light.,Great Gatsby
8,348,"Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey",Great Gatsby
8,349,clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the,Great Gatsby
8,350,faint dawn wind.,Great Gatsby
8,351,"“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she",Great Gatsby
8,352,might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the,Great Gatsby
8,353,window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and,Great Gatsby
8,354,leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what,Great Gatsby
8,355,"you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but",Great Gatsby
8,356,you can’t fool God!’ ”,Great Gatsby
8,357,"Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at",Great Gatsby
8,358,"the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and",Great Gatsby
8,359,"enormous, from the dissolving night.",Great Gatsby
8,360,"“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.",Great Gatsby
8,361,"“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him",Great Gatsby
8,362,turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson,Great Gatsby
8,363,"stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding",Great Gatsby
8,364,into the twilight.,Great Gatsby
8,365,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,366,"By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a",Great Gatsby
8,367,car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before,Great Gatsby
8,368,"who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which",Great Gatsby
8,369,"he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and",Great Gatsby
8,370,Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and,Great Gatsby
8,371,"hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.",Great Gatsby
8,372,His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to,Great Gatsby
8,373,"Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that",Great Gatsby
8,374,"he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and",Great Gatsby
8,375,"walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far",Great Gatsby
8,376,there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who,Great Gatsby
8,377,"had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared",Great Gatsby
8,378,oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared,Great Gatsby
8,379,"from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,",Great Gatsby
8,380,"that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time",Great Gatsby
8,381,"going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On",Great Gatsby
8,382,"the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and",Great Gatsby
8,383,"perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to",Great Gatsby
8,384,"know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the",Great Gatsby
8,385,way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.,Great Gatsby
8,386,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
8,387,At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the,Great Gatsby
8,388,butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the,Great Gatsby
8,389,pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had,Great Gatsby
8,390,"amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to",Great Gatsby
8,391,pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be,Great Gatsby
8,392,"taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the",Great Gatsby
8,393,front right fender needed repair.,Great Gatsby
8,394,Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he,Great Gatsby
8,395,"stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he",Great Gatsby
8,396,"needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among",Great Gatsby
8,397,the yellowing trees.,Great Gatsby
8,398,"No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep",Great Gatsby
8,399,and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone,Great Gatsby
8,400,to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t,Great Gatsby
8,401,"believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was",Great Gatsby
8,402,"true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a",Great Gatsby
8,403,high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have,Great Gatsby
8,404,looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered,Great Gatsby
8,405,as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight,Great Gatsby
8,406,"was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without",Great Gatsby
8,407,"being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted",Great Gatsby
8,408,"fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward",Great Gatsby
8,409,him through the amorphous trees.,Great Gatsby
8,410,The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the,Great Gatsby
8,411,shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything,Great Gatsby
8,412,much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house,Great Gatsby
8,413,and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that,Great Gatsby
8,414,"alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a",Great Gatsby
8,415,"word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried",Great Gatsby
8,416,down to the pool.,Great Gatsby
8,417,"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the",Great Gatsby
8,418,fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.,Great Gatsby
8,419,"With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden",Great Gatsby
8,420,mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that,Great Gatsby
8,421,scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental,Great Gatsby
8,422,course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves,Great Gatsby
8,423,"revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red",Great Gatsby
8,424,circle in the water.,Great Gatsby
8,425,It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener,Great Gatsby
8,426,"saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was",Great Gatsby
8,427,complete.,Great Gatsby
9,0,"After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and",Great Gatsby
9,1,"the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and",Great Gatsby
9,2,newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched,Great Gatsby
9,3,"across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but",Great Gatsby
9,4,"little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and",Great Gatsby
9,5,there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the,Great Gatsby
9,6,"pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the",Great Gatsby
9,7,"expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and",Great Gatsby
9,8,the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper,Great Gatsby
9,9,reports next morning.,Great Gatsby
9,10,"Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,",Great Gatsby
9,11,"eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought",Great Gatsby
9,12,to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale,Great Gatsby
9,13,"would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might",Great Gatsby
9,14,"have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount",Great Gatsby
9,15,of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes,Great Gatsby
9,16,"under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never",Great Gatsby
9,17,"seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,",Great Gatsby
9,18,that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced,Great Gatsby
9,19,"herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very",Great Gatsby
9,20,suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a,Great Gatsby
9,21,man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its,Great Gatsby
9,22,simplest form. And it rested there.,Great Gatsby
9,23,But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself,Great Gatsby
9,24,"on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the",Great Gatsby
9,25,"catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every",Great Gatsby
9,26,"practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and",Great Gatsby
9,27,"confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or",Great Gatsby
9,28,"speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because",Great Gatsby
9,29,"no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense",Great Gatsby
9,30,personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.,Great Gatsby
9,31,"I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her",Great Gatsby
9,32,instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away,Great Gatsby
9,33,"early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.",Great Gatsby
9,34,“Left no address?”,Great Gatsby
9,35,“No.”,Great Gatsby
9,36,“Say when they’d be back?”,Great Gatsby
9,37,“No.”,Great Gatsby
9,38,“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”,Great Gatsby
9,39,“I don’t know. Can’t say.”,Great Gatsby
9,40,I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where,Great Gatsby
9,41,"he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t",Great Gatsby
9,42,worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”,Great Gatsby
9,43,Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave me,Great Gatsby
9,44,"his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the",Great Gatsby
9,45,"time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the",Great Gatsby
9,46,phone.,Great Gatsby
9,47,“Will you ring again?”,Great Gatsby
9,48,“I’ve rung three times.”,Great Gatsby
9,49,“It’s very important.”,Great Gatsby
9,50,“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”,Great Gatsby
9,51,I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they,Great Gatsby
9,52,"were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled",Great Gatsby
9,53,"it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with",Great Gatsby
9,54,"shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:",Great Gatsby
9,55,"“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve got",Great Gatsby
9,56,to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”,Great Gatsby
9,57,"Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going",Great Gatsby
9,58,upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d,Great Gatsby
9,59,never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was,Great Gatsby
9,60,"nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,",Great Gatsby
9,61,staring down from the wall.,Great Gatsby
9,62,"Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,",Great Gatsby
9,63,which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next,Great Gatsby
9,64,train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure,Great Gatsby
9,65,"he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a",Great Gatsby
9,66,wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem,Great Gatsby
9,67,arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and,Great Gatsby
9,68,newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began,Great Gatsby
9,69,"to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby",Great Gatsby
9,70,and me against them all.,Great Gatsby
9,71,Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of,Great Gatsby
9,72,my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a,Great Gatsby
9,73,mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down,Great Gatsby
9,74,now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get,Great Gatsby
9,75,mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little,Great Gatsby
9,76,later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when,Great Gatsby
9,77,I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and,Great Gatsby
9,78,out.,Great Gatsby
9,79,Yours truly,Great Gatsby

9,82,Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.,Great Gatsby
9,83,When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was,Great Gatsby
9,84,calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came,Great Gatsby
9,85,"through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.",Great Gatsby
9,86,“This is Slagle speaking …”,Great Gatsby
9,87,“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.,Great Gatsby
9,88,"“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”",Great Gatsby
9,89,“There haven’t been any wires.”,Great Gatsby
9,90,"“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when",Great Gatsby
9,91,he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New,Great Gatsby
9,92,York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know,Great Gatsby
9,93,"about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”",Great Gatsby
9,94,“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr.,Great Gatsby
9,95,Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”,Great Gatsby
9,96,"There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an",Great Gatsby
9,97,exclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.,Great Gatsby
9,98,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
9,99,I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz,Great Gatsby
9,100,arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was,Great Gatsby
9,101,leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.,Great Gatsby
9,102,"It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,",Great Gatsby
9,103,bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His,Great Gatsby
9,104,"eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and",Great Gatsby
9,105,umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse,Great Gatsby
9,106,grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on,Great Gatsby
9,107,"the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him",Great Gatsby
9,108,"sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and",Great Gatsby
9,109,the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.,Great Gatsby
9,110,"“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the",Great Gatsby
9,111,Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”,Great Gatsby
9,112,“I didn’t know how to reach you.”,Great Gatsby
9,113,"His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.",Great Gatsby
9,114,"“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”",Great Gatsby
9,115,“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.,Great Gatsby
9,116,"“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”",Great Gatsby
9,117,“Carraway.”,Great Gatsby
9,118,"“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”",Great Gatsby
9,119,"I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him",Great Gatsby
9,120,there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into,Great Gatsby
9,121,"the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly",Great Gatsby
9,122,away.,Great Gatsby
9,123,"After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth",Great Gatsby
9,124,"ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and",Great Gatsby
9,125,unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the,Great Gatsby
9,126,"quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the",Great Gatsby
9,127,first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great,Great Gatsby
9,128,"rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be",Great Gatsby
9,129,mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he,Great Gatsby
9,130,took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been,Great Gatsby
9,131,deferred until he came.,Great Gatsby
9,132,"“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”",Great Gatsby
9,133,“Gatz is my name.”,Great Gatsby
9,134,“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”,Great Gatsby
9,135,He shook his head.,Great Gatsby
9,136,“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in,Great Gatsby
9,137,"the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”",Great Gatsby
9,138,“We were close friends.”,Great Gatsby
9,139,"“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,",Great Gatsby
9,140,but he had a lot of brain power here.”,Great Gatsby
9,141,"He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.",Great Gatsby
9,142,"“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J.",Great Gatsby
9,143,Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”,Great Gatsby
9,144,"“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.",Great Gatsby
9,145,"He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the",Great Gatsby
9,146,"bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.",Great Gatsby
9,147,"That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to",Great Gatsby
9,148,know who I was before he would give his name.,Great Gatsby
9,149,"“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.",Great Gatsby
9,150,“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.”,Great Gatsby
9,151,"I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at",Great Gatsby
9,152,Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a,Great Gatsby
9,153,"sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They",Great Gatsby
9,154,were hard to find.,Great Gatsby
9,155,"“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house.",Great Gatsby
9,156,I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”,Great Gatsby
9,157,"“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see",Great Gatsby
9,158,"anybody, but if I do.”",Great Gatsby
9,159,His tone made me suspicious.,Great Gatsby
9,160,“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”,Great Gatsby
9,161,"“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”",Great Gatsby
9,162,"“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”",Great Gatsby
9,163,"“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with",Great Gatsby
9,164,"some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with",Great Gatsby
9,165,"them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of",Great Gatsby
9,166,course I’ll do my best to get away.”,Great Gatsby
9,167,"I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he",Great Gatsby
9,168,went on nervously:,Great Gatsby
9,169,“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if,Great Gatsby
9,170,"it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see,",Great Gatsby
9,171,"they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My",Great Gatsby
9,172,address is care of B. F.—”,Great Gatsby
9,173,"I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.",Great Gatsby
9,174,After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I,Great Gatsby
9,175,"telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was",Great Gatsby
9,176,"my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at",Great Gatsby
9,177,"Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known",Great Gatsby
9,178,better than to call him.,Great Gatsby
9,179,The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer,Great Gatsby
9,180,Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I,Great Gatsby
9,181,"pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The",Great Gatsby
9,182,"Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone",Great Gatsby
9,183,"inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an",Great Gatsby
9,184,"argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess",Great Gatsby
9,185,appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile,Great Gatsby
9,186,eyes.,Great Gatsby
9,187,"“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”",Great Gatsby
9,188,"The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to",Great Gatsby
9,189,"whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.",Great Gatsby
9,190,“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”,Great Gatsby
9,191,"“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”",Great Gatsby
9,192,"At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!”",Great Gatsby
9,193,from the other side of the door.,Great Gatsby
9,194,"“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him",Great Gatsby
9,195,when he gets back.”,Great Gatsby
9,196,“But I know he’s there.”,Great Gatsby
9,197,She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up,Great Gatsby
9,198,and down her hips.,Great Gatsby
9,199,"“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she",Great Gatsby
9,200,"scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago,",Great Gatsby
9,201,he’s in Chicago.”,Great Gatsby
9,202,I mentioned Gatsby.,Great Gatsby
9,203,“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your,Great Gatsby
9,204,name?”,Great Gatsby
9,205,She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the,Great Gatsby
9,206,"doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking",Great Gatsby
9,207,"in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered",Great Gatsby
9,208,me a cigar.,Great Gatsby
9,209,"“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major",Great Gatsby
9,210,just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.,Great Gatsby
9,211,He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he,Great Gatsby
9,212,couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he,Great Gatsby
9,213,came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a,Great Gatsby
9,214,job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some,Great Gatsby
9,215,"lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food",Great Gatsby
9,216,in half an hour.”,Great Gatsby
9,217,“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.,Great Gatsby
9,218,“Start him! I made him.”,Great Gatsby
9,219,“Oh.”,Great Gatsby
9,220,"“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right",Great Gatsby
9,221,"away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told",Great Gatsby
9,222,me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join,Great Gatsby
9,223,the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did,Great Gatsby
9,224,some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like,Great Gatsby
9,225,that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”,Great Gatsby
9,226,I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series,Great Gatsby
9,227,transaction in 1919.,Great Gatsby
9,228,"“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend,",Great Gatsby
9,229,so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”,Great Gatsby
9,230,“I’d like to come.”,Great Gatsby
9,231,"“Well, come then.”",Great Gatsby
9,232,"The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head",Great Gatsby
9,233,his eyes filled with tears.,Great Gatsby
9,234,"“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.",Great Gatsby
9,235,“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”,Great Gatsby
9,236,“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any,Great Gatsby
9,237,way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend,Great Gatsby
9,238,"of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may",Great Gatsby
9,239,"think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”",Great Gatsby
9,240,"I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,",Great Gatsby
9,241,so I stood up.,Great Gatsby
9,242,“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.,Great Gatsby
9,243,"For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he",Great Gatsby
9,244,only nodded and shook my hand.,Great Gatsby
9,245,“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and,Great Gatsby
9,246,"not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let",Great Gatsby
9,247,everything alone.”,Great Gatsby
9,248,When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West,Great Gatsby
9,249,Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found,Great Gatsby
9,250,Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his,Great Gatsby
9,251,son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he,Great Gatsby
9,252,had something to show me.,Great Gatsby
9,253,“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling,Great Gatsby
9,254,fingers. “Look there.”,Great Gatsby
9,255,"It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty",Great Gatsby
9,256,with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look,Great Gatsby
9,257,there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so,Great Gatsby
9,258,often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.,Great Gatsby
9,259,“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up,Great Gatsby
9,260,well.”,Great Gatsby
9,261,“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”,Great Gatsby
9,262,“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in,Great Gatsby
9,263,"now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see",Great Gatsby
9,264,now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of,Great Gatsby
9,265,him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”,Great Gatsby
9,266,"He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another",Great Gatsby
9,267,"minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and",Great Gatsby
9,268,pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong,Great Gatsby
9,269,Cassidy.,Great Gatsby
9,270,"“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows",Great Gatsby
9,271,you.”,Great Gatsby
9,272,He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On,Great Gatsby

9,289,"“I came across this book by accident,” said the old man. “It just",Great Gatsby
9,290,"shows you, don’t it?”",Great Gatsby
9,291,“It just shows you.”,Great Gatsby
9,292,“Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this,Great Gatsby
9,293,or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He,Great Gatsby
9,294,"was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat",Great Gatsby
9,295,him for it.”,Great Gatsby
9,296,"He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then",Great Gatsby
9,297,looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the,Great Gatsby
9,298,list for my own use.,Great Gatsby
9,299,"A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and",Great Gatsby
9,300,I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did,Great Gatsby
9,301,Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and,Great Gatsby
9,302,"stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he",Great Gatsby
9,303,"spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced",Great Gatsby
9,304,"several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait",Great Gatsby
9,305,for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.,Great Gatsby
9,306,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
9,307,About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery,Great Gatsby
9,308,"and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse,",Great Gatsby
9,309,"horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the",Great Gatsby
9,310,"limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman",Great Gatsby
9,311,"from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we",Great Gatsby
9,312,started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then,Great Gatsby
9,313,the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I,Great Gatsby
9,314,looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found,Great Gatsby
9,315,marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months,Great Gatsby
9,316,before.,Great Gatsby
9,317,I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the,Great Gatsby
9,318,"funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and",Great Gatsby
9,319,he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled,Great Gatsby
9,320,from Gatsby’s grave.,Great Gatsby
9,321,"I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already",Great Gatsby
9,322,"too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that",Great Gatsby
9,323,Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur,Great Gatsby
9,324,"“Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed",Great Gatsby
9,325,"man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.",Great Gatsby
9,326,We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke,Great Gatsby
9,327,to me by the gate.,Great Gatsby
9,328,"“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.",Great Gatsby
9,329,“Neither could anybody else.”,Great Gatsby
9,330,"“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the",Great Gatsby
9,331,hundreds.”,Great Gatsby
9,332,"He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.",Great Gatsby
9,333,"“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.",Great Gatsby
9,334,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
9,335,One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school,Great Gatsby
9,336,and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than,Great Gatsby
9,337,Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a,Great Gatsby
9,338,"December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into",Great Gatsby
9,339,"their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember",Great Gatsby
9,340,the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the,Great Gatsby
9,341,chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught,Great Gatsby
9,342,"sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you",Great Gatsby
9,343,going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long,Great Gatsby
9,344,green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky,Great Gatsby
9,345,"yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking",Great Gatsby
9,346,cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.,Great Gatsby
9,347,"When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,",Great Gatsby
9,348,"began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and",Great Gatsby
9,349,"the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild",Great Gatsby
9,350,brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we,Great Gatsby
9,351,"walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware",Great Gatsby
9,352,"of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we",Great Gatsby
9,353,melted indistinguishably into it again.,Great Gatsby
9,354,That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede,Great Gatsby
9,355,"towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street",Great Gatsby
9,356,lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly,Great Gatsby
9,357,"wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a",Great Gatsby
9,358,"little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent",Great Gatsby
9,359,from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are,Great Gatsby
9,360,still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this,Great Gatsby
9,361,"has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and",Great Gatsby
9,362,"Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some",Great Gatsby
9,363,deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.,Great Gatsby
9,364,"Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware",Great Gatsby
9,365,"of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the",Great Gatsby
9,366,"Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the",Great Gatsby
9,367,children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of,Great Gatsby
9,368,"distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic",Great Gatsby
9,369,"dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at",Great Gatsby
9,370,"once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging",Great Gatsby
9,371,sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress,Great Gatsby
9,372,suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a,Great Gatsby
9,373,"drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over",Great Gatsby
9,374,"the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a",Great Gatsby
9,375,"house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one",Great Gatsby
9,376,cares.,Great Gatsby
9,377,"After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted",Great Gatsby
9,378,beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle,Great Gatsby
9,379,leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the,Great Gatsby
9,380,line I decided to come back home.,Great Gatsby
9,381,"There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant",Great Gatsby
9,382,thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to,Great Gatsby
9,383,leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent,Great Gatsby
9,384,sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and,Great Gatsby
9,385,"around what had happened to us together, and what had happened",Great Gatsby
9,386,"afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big",Great Gatsby
9,387,chair.,Great Gatsby
9,388,"She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like",Great Gatsby
9,389,"a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the",Great Gatsby
9,390,"colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the",Great Gatsby
9,391,fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without,Great Gatsby
9,392,"comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though",Great Gatsby
9,393,"there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I",Great Gatsby
9,394,pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t,Great Gatsby
9,395,"making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up",Great Gatsby
9,396,to say goodbye.,Great Gatsby
9,397,"“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw",Great Gatsby
9,398,"me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it",Great Gatsby
9,399,"was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”",Great Gatsby
9,400,We shook hands.,Great Gatsby
9,401,"“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about",Great Gatsby
9,402,driving a car?”,Great Gatsby
9,403,“Why—not exactly.”,Great Gatsby
9,404,“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?,Great Gatsby
9,405,"Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me",Great Gatsby
9,406,"to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,",Great Gatsby
9,407,straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”,Great Gatsby
9,408,"“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and",Great Gatsby
9,409,call it honour.”,Great Gatsby
9,410,"She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously",Great Gatsby
9,411,"sorry, I turned away.",Great Gatsby
9,412,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
9,413,One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead,Great Gatsby
9,414,"of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a",Great Gatsby
9,415,"little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving",Great Gatsby
9,416,"sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as",Great Gatsby
9,417,I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into,Great Gatsby
9,418,"the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,",Great Gatsby
9,419,holding out his hand.,Great Gatsby
9,420,"“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”",Great Gatsby
9,421,“Yes. You know what I think of you.”,Great Gatsby
9,422,"“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know",Great Gatsby
9,423,what’s the matter with you.”,Great Gatsby
9,424,"“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”",Great Gatsby
9,425,"He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about",Great Gatsby
9,426,"those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after",Great Gatsby
9,427,me and grabbed my arm.,Great Gatsby
9,428,"“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were",Great Gatsby
9,429,"getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in",Great Gatsby
9,430,he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if,Great Gatsby
9,431,I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his,Great Gatsby
9,432,pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.,Great Gatsby
9,433,“What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw,Great Gatsby
9,434,"dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough",Great Gatsby
9,435,one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even,Great Gatsby
9,436,stopped his car.”,Great Gatsby
9,437,"There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it",Great Gatsby
9,438,wasn’t true.,Great Gatsby
9,439,"“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when",Great Gatsby
9,440,I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits,Great Gatsby
9,441,"sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By",Great Gatsby
9,442,God it was awful—”,Great Gatsby
9,443,"I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done",Great Gatsby
9,444,"was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and",Great Gatsby
9,445,"confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up",Great Gatsby
9,446,things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their,Great Gatsby
9,447,"vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let",Great Gatsby
9,448,other people clean up the mess they had made …,Great Gatsby
9,449,"I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as",Great Gatsby
9,450,though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery,Great Gatsby
9,451,store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff,Great Gatsby
9,452,buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.,Great Gatsby
9,453,------------------------------------------------------------------------,Great Gatsby
9,454,Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had,Great Gatsby
9,455,grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never,Great Gatsby
9,456,took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and,Great Gatsby
9,457,pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to,Great Gatsby
9,458,"East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story",Great Gatsby
9,459,about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when,Great Gatsby
9,460,I got off the train.,Great Gatsby
9,461,"I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,",Great Gatsby
9,462,dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still,Great Gatsby
9,463,"hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,",Great Gatsby
9,464,and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a,Great Gatsby
9,465,"material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I",Great Gatsby
9,466,didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away,Great Gatsby
9,467,at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.,Great Gatsby
9,468,"On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,",Great Gatsby
9,469,I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once,Great Gatsby
9,470,"more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a",Great Gatsby
9,471,"piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,",Great Gatsby
9,472,drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the,Great Gatsby
9,473,beach and sprawled out on the sand.,Great Gatsby
9,474,Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any,Great Gatsby
9,475,"lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the",Great Gatsby
9,476,Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to,Great Gatsby
9,477,melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that,Great Gatsby
9,478,"flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new",Great Gatsby
9,479,"world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s",Great Gatsby
9,480,"house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all",Great Gatsby
9,481,human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his,Great Gatsby
9,482,"breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic",Great Gatsby
9,483,"contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the",Great Gatsby
9,484,last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for,Great Gatsby
9,485,wonder.,Great Gatsby
9,486,"And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of",Great Gatsby
9,487,Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of,Great Gatsby
9,488,"Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream",Great Gatsby
9,489,must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He,Great Gatsby
9,490,"did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that",Great Gatsby
9,491,"vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic",Great Gatsby
9,492,rolled on under the night.,Great Gatsby
9,493,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by",Great Gatsby
9,494,"year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no",Great Gatsby
9,495,"matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And",Great Gatsby
9,496,one fine morning—,Great Gatsby
9,497,"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into",Great Gatsby
9,498,the past.,Great Gatsby
