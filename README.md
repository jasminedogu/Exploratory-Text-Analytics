# Exploratory-Text-Analytics
This is the repository for my DS 5001 Class's Final Project. This project was finished in late May but may be continued during the Summer.

Please note, currently it does not have the db files with the environments for each file. Similarly, it is missing some of the output data. This is due to the nature of the files (they are extremely big). However, all of this can be saved/created locally on your machine by running each file in order.

There is a final paper included in the repository for my project. This paper is not comprehensive of all of the code that was written due to the length restrictions for the paper. The individual ipybn files, however, do have text to help explain what the purpose is/what is going on.
