# Exploratory-Text-Analytics
This is the repository for my DS 5001 Class's Final Project. This is being worked on, and will be finished late May.

This repository will continuously be updated. Please note, currently it does not have the db files with the environments for each file. Similarly, it is missing some of the output data. This is due to the nature of the files (they are extremely big). However, all of this can be saved/created locally on your machine by running each file in order.
